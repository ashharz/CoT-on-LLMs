0,"[INST] A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?
Answer Choices:
A) 5 ( √ 3 + 1)
B) 6 ( √ 3 + √ 2)
C) 7 ( √ 3 – 1)
D) 8 ( √ 3 – 2)
E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use trigonometry to solve this problem!

We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so we can use the tangent ratio to find the change in height:

tan(60°) = height / distance

We know that the distance is the length of the tower, and the height is the difference between the initial and final angles. So we can set up the equation:

height = distance x tan(45°) / tan(60°)

Now we can solve for the height:

height = distance x tan(45°) / tan(60°)
= distance x 1 / √3

Since the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, we know that the height increases by 15° (since the tangent ratio increases by 1/√3). So the height of the tower is:

height = distance x 1 / √3
= distance x 15° / 180°
= 1/2 distance

Now we can find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower:

time = distance / speed

We know that the speed is constant, so we can use the initial angle of 45° to find the distance:

distance = speed x time x tan(45°)
= speed x time x 1 / √3

Now we can substitute the values we have found:

distance = speed x time x 1 / √3
= 1/2 distance x 10 minutes / 1 minute
= 5 minutes

So it will take 5 minutes for the car to reach the base of the tower.

The answer is:

B) 6 ( √3 + √2)

Note that the correct answer is 6, not 5, because the distance traveled is 5 minutes x speed, not just 5 minutes.",A

Answer Choices:
A) $ 61
B) $ 65
C) $ 67.40
D) $ 70
E) $ 78.20
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

1. The original price of the item was discounted 22%.
2. The customer bought the item at the discounted price using a $20 off coupon.
3. There is no tax on the item.
4. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item.

We can start by finding half of the original price:

Half of $61 = $61 / 2 = $30.50

Since the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, we can add $1.90 to $30.50:

$30.50 + $1.90 = $32.40

Now, we can subtract the amount of the coupon:

$32.40 - $20 = $12.40

So, the original price of the item was $12.40.

Answer Choices:
A) 0.22
B) 0.26
C) 0.37
D) 0.46
E) 0.63
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur, we need to find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value.

We can do this by multiplying the probabilities of each event not occurring:

P(neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase) = P(Stock A will not increase) x P(Stock B will not increase)

Using the given probabilities:

P(Stock A will not increase) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
P(Stock B will not increase) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26

P(neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase) = 0.44 x 0.26 = 0.1136

So, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.1136, or approximately 11.36%.

E) 315
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say the cost price of the article is x.

The selling price of the article is 120% of the cost price, so the selling price is:

120% of x = 360

To find the cost price, we can divide both sides of the equation by 120:

x = 360 / 120

x = 3

So, the cost price of the article is 3.

The answer is: C) 280.",B
5,"[INST] 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles , painted black , and then put back in . Then , another 20 marbles were pulled out , of which 1 was black , after which they were all returned to the bag . If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag , how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold ?
Answer Choices:
A) 40
B) 200
C) 380
D) 400
E) 3200
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the number of white marbles in the bag x.

The first time, 20 marbles were pulled out, all of which were painted black, so the number of black marbles pulled out is 20.

The second time, 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 was black. So, the number of black marbles pulled out the second time is 1/20 = 0.05 or 5%.

Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up the following equation:

5% of the total number of marbles in the bag = 1/20 of the total number of marbles pulled out the second time

Now, we know that the total number of marbles pulled out the second time is 20, so we can substitute that in:

5% of the total number of marbles in the bag = 1/20 of 20

Simplifying, we get:

5% of the total number of marbles in the bag = 1/20 of 20

5% of the total number of marbles in the bag = 1/20 x 20

5% of the total number of marbles in the bag = 10

Now, we can solve for the total number of marbles in the bag:

The total number of marbles in the bag = 10 x (100/5)

The total number of marbles in the bag = 10 x 20

The total number of marbles in the bag = 200

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 200.",D

Since we need to ensure that the letters are distinct, we need to choose the letters from a set of 26 - 1 = 25 letters.

Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is:

25 x 676 = 16800

Answer Choices:
A) 10
B) 11.5
C) 12.5
D) 13.5
E) 15
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem:

1. The train starts at a speed of 100 miles/hour.
2. It covers 1/4 of the distance in 2.5 hours (since it takes 10 hours to cover the entire distance).
3. The train slows down to 75 miles/hour due to rain.

We can calculate the total journey duration as follows:

Total distance = (1/4 distance) + (3/4 distance)

Total distance = (1/4) x (100 miles/hour) x 2.5 hours + (3/4) x (100 miles/hour) x (7.5 hours)

Total distance = 25 miles + 225 miles

Total distance = 250 miles

Total journey duration = Total distance / Speed

Total journey duration = 250 miles / 75 miles/hour

Total journey duration = 3.33 hours (or 3 hours and 20 minutes)

Prom Night: 45% of 200 = 90 students attended the prom night
Debating Session: 35% of 200 = 70 students took part in the debating session

Students who attended neither event:

Total number of students - (Prom Night + Debating Session)

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To reach a salary of at least $1000, the salesperson needs to earn $1000 - $250 = $750 in commissions.

Since the commission rate is 10%, the salesperson needs to make:

$750 / 0.10 = $7500 in sales

Since each sale is $250, the salesperson needs to make:

$7500 / $250 = 24 sales

Therefore, the answer is:

B) 24 sales.",D

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, the company needs to sell each component at a price that covers the production cost of $110 and generates a profit.

Let's calculate the minimum selling price per component:

Yearly profit = (420 components/month x $110 production cost/component x 12 months) - (420 components/month x $110 production cost/component x 12 months)

Yearly profit = $5,040,000 - $5,040,000

Yearly profit = $0

To achieve a yearly profit of $626,400, the company needs to sell each component at a price that is at least $626,400 / 420 components = $1,480 per component.

We know that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price, so the profit per bag is:

Profit per bag = $100 x 25% = $25

We also know that the grocer makes a total profit of $3,000, so the total profit from all bags sold is:

Total profit = Number of bags x Profit per bag = x x $25

We can set up an equation:

x x $25 = $3,000

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by $25:

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by identifying the number of students in each subject:

* Math: 1/16 of the students study math, so there are 16x1 = 16 students studying math.
* Bio: 1/10 of the students study bio, so there are 10x1 = 10 students studying bio.
* English: 1/8 of the students study english, so there are 8x1 = 8 students studying english.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we know that the sum of the number of students in each subject must be a multiple of 10. Let's add the number of students in each subject:

16 + 10 + 8 = 34

Since the sum of the number of students in each subject is not a multiple of 10, we know that the total number of students must be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the total number of students is:

34 + 0 = 34 x 10 = 340

So, the maximum number of students is 340.

Now, let's find the minimum number of students. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8. We can use the following steps to find the LCM:

Answer Choices:
A) 126 km
B) 144 km
C) 127 km
D) 228 km
E) 128 km
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

1. The jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey.
2. In the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr.

We can start by finding the distance traveled in the forward journey:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = (Speed in forward journey) x 6 hours

Since the speed in the forward journey is not given, we can't find the distance directly.

Now, let's find the distance traveled in the return journey:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = (12 km/hr more than the speed in forward journey) x 4 hours

Since the speed in the return journey is 12 km/hr more than the speed in the forward journey, we can find the speed in the return journey:

Speed in return journey = Speed in forward journey + 12 km/hr

Now, we can find the distance traveled in the return journey:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = (Speed in return journey) x 4 hours

Substituting the value of speed in the return journey:

Distance = (Speed in return journey) x 4 hours
Distance = (Speed in forward journey + 12 km/hr) x 4 hours

Now, we can find the distance traveled in the return journey:

Distance = (Speed in forward journey + 12 km/hr) x 4 hours

Now, we can find the total distance traveled by the jeep:

Total distance = Distance in forward journey + Distance in return journey

Total distance = (Speed in forward journey) x 6 hours + (Speed in return journey) x 4 hours

Substituting the values:

Total distance = (Speed in forward journey) x 6 hours + (Speed in return journey) x 4 hours
Total distance = (Speed in forward journey) x 6 hours + (Speed in forward journey + 12 km/hr) x 4 hours

Now, we can simplify and solve for the total distance:

Total distance = (Speed in forward journey) x 6 hours + (Speed in forward journey + 12 km/hr) x 4 hours

30,"[INST] The original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost . If the appliance was actually sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price , then it was sold for what percent more than its wholesale cost ?
Answer Choices:
A) 20 %
B) 28 %
C) 36 %
D) 40 %
E) 42 %
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:

1. Original retail price = 60% more than wholesale cost
2. Discount = 20% off original retail price
3. Sale price = original retail price - discount

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Original retail price = Wholesale cost x 1.6 (60% increase)
Sale price = Original retail price - 20% of original retail price

Substituting the values, we get:

Sale price = (Wholesale cost x 1.6) - 20% of (Wholesale cost x 1.6)

Simplifying and solving for the sale price, we get:

Sale price = (Wholesale cost x 1.6) - (20% of (Wholesale cost x 1.6))
= (Wholesale cost x 1.6) - (20% x (Wholesale cost x 1.6))
= (Wholesale cost x 1.6) - (20% x 1.6 x Wholesale cost)
= (Wholesale cost x 1.6) - (20% x 1.6 x Wholesale cost)

Now, we can see that the sale price is a percentage of the wholesale cost, and we can find the percentage by dividing the sale price by the wholesale cost:

Sale price / Wholesale cost = (Sale price / (Wholesale cost x 1.6))
= (Sale price / (1.6 x Wholesale cost))
= (Sale price / 1.6 x Wholesale cost)

Simplifying and solving for the percentage, we get:

(Sale price / Wholesale cost) = (1 - 20%)
= (1 - 0.20)
= 0.8

So, the sale price is 80% of the wholesale cost.

The answer is:

C) 36%

A) 1584
B) 1120
C) 792
D) 1320
E) 1200
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the length of the rectangular sheet x cm.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each half is:

2(x + x) = 2x + 2x = 4x

Since the perimeter is 48 cm, we can set up the equation:

4x = 48

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12

So, the length of the rectangular sheet is 12 cm.

When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each half is:

2(x + x) = 2x + 2x = 4x

Again, the perimeter is 66 cm, so we can set up the equation:

4x = 66

Solving for x, we get:

x = 17

So, the length of the rectangular sheet is 17 cm when folded along the other set of sides.

Now, we can find the area of the sheet by multiplying the length by the width:

Area = length x width
= 12 cm x 17 cm
= 204 cm^2

B) 15.8113
C) 18.3451
D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B) 15.8113.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the volume of a rectangular solid, which is:

V = length x width x height

In this case, the length, width, and height of the rectangular solid are 3, 4, and 15, respectively.

Since the rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, all eight of its vertices must be on the sphere. This means that the radius of the sphere must be equal to the height of the rectangular solid, which is 15.

The volume of the sphere (V) can be found using the formula:

V = (4/3)πr^3

where r is the radius of the sphere.

Substituting the value of r (15) into the formula, we get:

V = (4/3)π(15)^3

V = 4π(15)^2

V = 4(15)^2

V = 4(225)

V = 900

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the diameter of the sphere:

V = 900

The diameter of the sphere is 3 times the radius, so:

3(15) = 45

The diameter of the sphere is 45.

Therefore, the answer is B) 15.8113.",B

B) Rs . 712.50
C) Rs . 787.50
D) Rs . 750
E) Rs . 780
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say the marked price of the watch is x.

The shopkeeper gives a discount of 7% on the marked price, so the selling price is:

x - (7% of x) = x - (0.07x)

We know that the shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit if he gives a discount of 7%, so the profit he earns is:

Profit = (selling price - marked price) = (x - x) = 0

Since the profit is zero, we can set up the equation:

0 = x - (0.07x)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 750

So, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say the number the student found the value of 7/18 of is x.

We know that the correct value of 7/8 of x is x/8.

The student found the value of 7/18 of x, which is 7/18x.

We know that the difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is 770.

So, we can set up the equation:

7/18x - x/8 = 770

Simplifying the equation:

7/18 - 1/8 = 770

We can see that the left-hand side is a constant, so we can equate it to the right-hand side:

7/18 = 770/8

C) $ 30000
D) $ 20000
E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the monthly sales x.

We know that the shop assistant's monthly salary is the sum of a fixed salary of $500 plus 5% of all monthly sales, so we can write the equation:

S = 500 + 0.05x

We also know that we want the shop assistant's monthly salary to be $1500, so we can set up the equation:

1500 = 500 + 0.05x

Now we can solve for x:

1500 = 500 + 0.05x
1500 - 500 = 0.05x
1000 = 0.05x

Now we can divide both sides by 0.05 to solve for x:

1000 / 0.05 = x
20000 = x

So the monthly sales should be $20,000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to be $1500.

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find out when the two cars will meet, we need to find the time it takes for each car to travel the distance of the highway.

Car 1 is traveling at 12 mph, so it will take:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 50 miles / 12 mph
Time = 4.17 hours (rounded to the nearest tenth)

Car 2 is traveling at 13 mph, so it will take:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 50 miles / 13 mph
Time = 3.85 hours (rounded to the nearest tenth)

Since both cars start at the same time, we need to find the difference in time between them:

Time difference = Time for Car 2 - Time for Car 1
Time difference = 3.85 hours - 4.17 hours
Time difference = 0.32 hours (rounded to the nearest tenth)

Interest rate = (Total interest / Principal) x (1 / Number of periods)

In this case, the principal is Rs. 360, the total interest is the sum of the monthly installments, and the number of periods is 12.

Total interest = 12 x Rs. 31.50 = Rs. 378

Interest rate = (Rs. 378 / Rs. 360) x (1 / 12)

Interest rate = (378 / 360) x (1 / 12)

Interest rate = 378 / 360 x 1 / 12

Interest rate = 378 / 360 x 0.0833

Interest rate = 4.5%

Answer Choices:
A) 453
B) 651
C) 400
D) 487
E) 286
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use a system of linear equations to solve this problem. Let x be the number of 25 paise coins, y be the number of 50 paise coins, and z be the number of one rupee coins.

We know that the total amount of money in the pouch is Rs. 700, so we can write the following equation:

x + y + z = 700

We also know that the total number of coins is equal to the number of 25 paise coins plus the number of 50 paise coins plus the number of one rupee coins, so we can write:

x + y + z = 3(25 paise coins) + 2(50 paise coins) + 1(one rupee coin)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + y + z = 3(25) + 2(50) + 1(100)

x + y + z = 750

Now we can solve for x, y, and z. We know that the number of 25 paise coins is 3 times 25, so:

x = 3(25) = 75

The number of 50 paise coins is 2 times 50, so:

y = 2(50) = 100

And the number of one rupee coins is 1, so:

z = 1

Therefore, the number of each type of coin is:

x = 75
y = 100
z = 1

The answer is:

The answer is C) 400.",C

B) Rs . 4270
C) Rs . 4000
D) Rs . 3937.50
E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the monthly income of the man, we can use the information that he spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2 % of his income.

Let X be the monthly income of the man.

We know that the man spends Rs. 3500 per month, so we can set up the equation:

X - 12.5% of X = 3500

where 12.5% is the percentage of the man's income that he saves.

To solve for X, we can first calculate 12.5% of X:

12.5% of X = 12.5/100 x X

Now, we can substitute the equation we set up earlier:

12.5% of X = X - 3500

Now, we can solve for X:

X = 3500 + 12.5% of X

X = 3500 + (12.5/100) x X

X = 3500 + 12.5 x X

Now, we can simplify:

X = 3500 + 12.5 x X

X = 3500 + 12.5 x (3500 + 12.5% of X)

X = 3500 + 12.5 x (3500 + 12.5 x X)

X = 3500 + 12.5 x (3500 + 12.5 x X)

Now, we can see that the equation is in the form of a geometric series:

X = 3500 + 12.5 x (3500 + 12.5 x X)

We can use the formula for a geometric series to solve for X:

X = 3500 + 12.5 x (3500 + 12.5 x X)

X = 3500 + 12.5 x (3500 + 12.5 x X)

X = 35",C

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 10.

Here's the calculation:

Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he would have completed 3 houses in 6 x 3 = 18 days.

Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he would have completed 3 houses in 8 x 3 = 24 days.

Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he would have completed 3 houses in 12 x 3 = 36 days.

Since Mr. Brown goes on vacation after 8 days, he will not complete any more houses. Mr. Black will work for 6 days, so he will complete 3 houses in 6 x 3 = 18 days.

Therefore, Mr. Blue will complete the remaining 3 houses in 36 - 18 = 18 days.

C) 190 minutes
D) 70 minutes
E) 35 minutes
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the situation:

Train A leaves the station every 16 minutes, so the time between two consecutive departures of Train A is 16 minutes.
Train B leaves the station every 17 minutes, so the time between two consecutive departures of Train B is 17 minutes.

Since both trains left the station simultaneously, we can say that the time between the departure of Train A and the departure of Train B is 16 + 17 = 33 minutes.

Now, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17 to determine when both trains will depart the station again.

The multiples of 16 are: 16, 32, 48, 64, ...
The multiples of 17 are: 17, 34, 51, 68, ...

B) 550
C) 500
D) 450
E) 498
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted, we need to calculate the volume of the hollow cube and subtract the volume of the smaller cubes that are fully painted.

The volume of the hollow cube is:

5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm = 125 cubic centimeters

The volume of a single smaller cube is:

1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm = 1 cubic centimeter

So, the number of smaller cubes that can fit in the hollow cube is:

125 cubic centimeters / 1 cubic centimeter = 125 smaller cubes

Now, we need to subtract the number of smaller cubes that are fully painted from the total number of smaller cubes. Since each face of the hollow cube has 6 smaller cubes attached to it, each face of the hollow cube has 6 unpainted faces.

Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is:

125 smaller cubes - (6 x 6) = 125 - 36 = 89

The answer is:

C) 89

So, 89 faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.",A

B) 2 %
C) 5 %
D) 9 %
E) 10 %
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use a systematic approach to solve this problem.

Let's say there are x chocolates that are vanilla flavored and not squashed.

We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so there are 10% of x chocolates that are cocoa flavored.

We also know that 90% of the remaining chocolates are squashed, so there are 90% of (100 - x) chocolates that are squashed.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

10% of x + 90% of (100 - x) = 100

Simplifying the equation:

10x + 90(100 - x) = 100

Now we can solve for x:

10x + 9000 - 90x = 100

90x = 8100

x = 8100 / 90

x = 90

So there are 90 chocolates that are vanilla flavored and not squashed.

x + (x - 1) = 50

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 1 = 50

Solving for x:

x = 25

So, R's age is 25 and T's age is 25 - 1 = 24.

The difference between R and Q's age is:

R's age - Q's age = 25 - (25 - 1) = 25 - 24 = 1

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile, we need to find the point at which the total cost of the ride reaches $8.50.

Let's start by calculating the cost of the first quarter mile:

Cost of first quarter mile = $3.50

Now, let's calculate the cost of each additional quarter mile:

Cost of each additional quarter mile = $0.10 x (number of quarter miles)

Since we want to find the maximum distance we can travel, we need to find the point at which the total cost of the ride reaches $8.50. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Total cost = Cost of first quarter mile + Cost of each additional quarter mile

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Total cost = $3.50 + (number of quarter miles x $0.10)

We want the total cost to be $8.50, so we can set up an equation:

$3.50 + (number of quarter miles x $0.10) = $8.50

Now, we can solve for the number of quarter miles:

$3.50 + (number of quarter miles x $0.10) = $8.50

Subtracting $3.50 from both sides gives us:

(number of quarter miles x $0.10) = $5.00

Dividing both sides by $0.10 gives us:

Number of quarter miles = 50

Now, we can calculate the total distance traveled:

Total distance = Number of quarter miles x Quarter mile distance

Total distance = 50 x 0.25

Total distance = 12.5 miles

So, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile is 12.5 miles.

We know that his batting average before the finals was 51, and he scored 78 runs in the finals. To calculate his new batting average, we can use the formula:

New Average = (Old Average + Scores in Finals) / Total Number of Matches

In this case, the old average is 51, the scores in the finals are 78, and we want to find out the total number of matches played.

So, we can set up the equation:

New Average = (51 + 78) / x

Where x is the total number of matches played.

Solving for x, we get:

x = (51 + 78) / x

x = 54

Therefore, the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season is 10.

D) 63 m
E) 64 m
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l + w) , where l is the length and w is the width.

Since the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, we can write:

l = 4w + 1

We know that the area of the rectangle is 150 square meters, so we can write:

A = lw = (4w + 1)w = 4w^2 + 1

Now we can substitute the value of A into the formula for perimeter:

P = 2(l + w) = 2(4w + 1) = 8w + 2

So the perimeter of the rectangle is:

P = 8w + 2

Now we just need to find the value of w. We know that the area of the rectangle is 150 square meters, so we can set up the equation:

4w^2 + 1 = 150

Solving for w, we get:

w = 35

Now we can find the length of the rectangle:

l = 4w + 1 = 4(35) + 1 = 140 + 1 = 141

So the perimeter of the rectangle is:

P = 8w + 2 = 8(35) + 2 = 280 + 2 = 282

E) 16.5
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To determine the amount of health food needed to provide the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, we need to first find out the minimum daily requirements of each vitamin.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 9% of the daily requirement, so:

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin E = 100 x 9% = 9 grams

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 8% of the daily requirement, so:

Minimum daily requirement of vitamin A = 100 x 8% = 8 grams

Now, we can find out the total minimum daily requirement of both vitamins:

Total minimum daily requirement = Minimum daily requirement of vitamin E + Minimum daily requirement of vitamin A
= 9 + 8
= 17 grams

To provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to consume at least 17 grams of the health food.

The answer is:

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To determine how many helpers are required, we need to use the information provided to find out how many large cakes and small cakes can be made in total, and then divide that number by the number of cakes each helper can make per hour.

First, let's calculate the total number of cakes that need to be made:

20 large cakes x 2 per large cake = 40 large cakes
700 small cakes x 35 per small cake = 24,500 small cakes

Total number of cakes = 40 + 24,500 = 24,540

Now, let's divide the total number of cakes by the number of cakes each helper can make per hour:

24,540 / 2 large cakes per hour = 12,270 hours
24,540 / 35 small cakes per hour = 695 hours

Since we have 3 hours available, we can calculate the number of helpers needed as follows:

12,270 hours / 3 hours = 4,090 helpers (for large cakes)
695 hours / 3 hours = 231 helpers (for small cakes)

Therefore, the answer is:

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the length of line segment RU, we can use the fact that U is the midpoint of line segment ST.

Let's call the length of line segment ST = x.

We know that the length of line segment RS = 5, and the length of line segment RT = 17.

Using the midpoint formula, we can find the length of line segment RU as follows:

RU = (ST + RS) / 2

= (x + 5) / 2

= (x + 5) / 2

We know that the sum of the lengths of line segments RS and RT is equal to the length of line segment ST:

RS + RT = ST

5 + 17 = x

22 = x

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is:

RU = (x + 5) / 2

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by analyzing the information given:

* Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
* Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.

We can start by finding the common denominator between the two statements:

* Six pita breads = 2 rolls
* Three rolls = 5 baguettes

Now, we can see that one roll is equal to 2 pita breads and one baguette is equal to 5 pita breads.

So, to find out how many pita breads two baguettes are equal to, we can divide the number of pita breads in one baguette by the number of pita breads in one roll:

5 pita breads in one baguette ÷ 2 pita breads in one roll = 2.5 pita breads

70,"[INST] A shopkeeper in order to promote his new shop put a discount of 20 % on all the items for one day . Now he must sell the items at original price the other day . By what percentage must he increase the price to original ?
Answer Choices:
A) 21 %
B) 20 %
C) 25 %
D) 33 %
E) 18 %
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To determine the percentage increase needed to return to the original price, we need to find the percentage difference between the original price and the discounted price.

Let's say the original price of an item was $100. With a 20% discount, the price would be:

$100 x 0.8 = $80

To return to the original price, we need to increase the discounted price by the percentage difference between the two prices:

($80 - $100) / $100 = 20%

So, to increase the price back to the original price, we need to increase it by 20%.

The answer is:

B) 20%",C

Answer Choices:
A) 126
B) 77
C) 88
D) 66
E) 54
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

The bus fare for two persons for traveling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare for one person.

So, we can write:

Bus fare = 4/3 Train fare

We know that the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus is Rs. 1512.

So, we can write:

6 x Bus fare = 6 x 4/3 Train fare = 6 x Train fare

Now, we know that the total fare paid by 8 persons traveling by train is also Rs. 1512.

So, we can write:

8 x Train fare = 8 x 6/3 Bus fare = 8 x Bus fare

Now, we can solve for Train fare:

Train fare = 6 x Bus fare / 8
= 6 x 1512 / 8
= 126

So, the answer is:

To find the length of the fence, we need to calculate the total width of all the pickets:

13 pickets x 1/2 inch/picket = 6.5 inches

Since there is 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, we need to subtract the space between each pair:

6.5 inches - 6 inches = 0.5 inches

So, the length of the fence is:

0.5 inches x 13 pickets = 6.5 inches

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the speed of the ship x miles per hour.

The plane starts with 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10x miles per hour.

After 180 miles, the ship has traveled a distance of 180 miles.

The plane, starting from the same point, has traveled a distance of:

180 + (10 x 180) = 180 + 1800 = 2000 miles

Answer Choices:
A) 300
B) 500
C) 5000
D) 6000
E) 7500
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

1. In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned.
2. In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which 20 had tags from the previous year.

We can assume that the 20 deer with tags from the previous year were part of the 300 deer caught in 2001, as they were tagged and returned.

Now, let's calculate the percentage of deer in the forest with tags:

Percentage of deer with tags = (Number of deer with tags / Total number of deer) x 100

In 2001, there were 300 deer caught, tagged, and returned, so the number of deer with tags is 300.

In 2002, there were 500 deer caught at random, of which 20 had tags from the previous year, so the total number of deer is 500 + 20 = 520.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of deer with tags:

Percentage of deer with tags = (20 / 520) x 100 = 3.85%

Since the percentage of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percentage of the total deer population in the forest with tags, we can assume that the same percentage of deer in the entire forest have tags.

Now, we can calculate the total deer population in the forest:

Total deer population = (100 / 3.85) x 520 = 7500

The answer is:

E) 7500

Note: We assumed that the percentage of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percentage of the total deer population in the forest with tags, which may not be the case in reality.",E

What is the probability of the man catching the first train ?
Answer Choices:
A) 0.9
B) 0.8
C) 0.6
D) 0.65
E) 1.5
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The first train on the main line starts at 5 o'clock, and the first train on the harbor line starts at 5:02 AM.

The man wants to catch the first train, so he will go to the station at 5 o'clock.

The probability of the man catching the first train on the main line is 1/2, since there are two trains on the main line and the man can catch either one.

The probability of the man catching the first train on the harbor line is 1/3, since there are three trains on the harbor line and the man can catch any one of them.

Since the man wants to catch the first train, he will go to the station at 5 o'clock, and the probability of him catching the first train is the probability of him catching the first train on the main line plus the probability of him catching the first train on the harbor line:

1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6

So, the probability of the man catching the first train is 5/6, or approximately 0.83.

D) 43.5
E) 44.8
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say the weight of the 10 vehicles before the new heavy duty truck was added is x tons.

The average weight of the group of vehicles before the new truck was added is:

x + (9 x 12.2) / 10 = 12.2

Simplifying the equation:

x + 108.2 / 10 = 12.2

x = 40.8

So, the weight of the 10 vehicles before the new heavy duty truck was added is 40.8 tons.

The weight of the new heavy duty truck is:

44.8 - 40.8 = 4 tons

Therefore, the answer is:

The weight of the new heavy duty truck is 4 tons.

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

According to the problem, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, so we can set up the equation:

y = 2x

Now, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 10 = 3y - 30

Now we can solve both equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we get:

y = 2x

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

x + 10 = 3(2x) - 30

x + 10 = 6x - 30

Simplifying, we get:

x = 42

So Arjun has $42 and Sajal has $34.

C) 10 feet
D) 50 feet
E) 60 feet
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length x Width

Since we know the width of the yard is 100 feet, and the total area is 3,000 square feet, we can set up the equation:

3,000 = 100 x Length

To solve for the length, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100:

Length = 3,000 / 100

Length = 30

So, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

The answer is:

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers. In this case, the GCF of 350 and the other integer is 11.

The least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers is the smallest positive integer that both numbers divide. In this case, the LCM of 350 and the other integer is 7700.

Since the GCF is 11, we know that the other integer must be a multiple of 11. The least common multiple of 11 is 11 x 7 = 77. Therefore, the other integer is 350 + 77 = 427.

Answer Choices:
A) 56
B) 58
C) 60
D) 62
E) 64
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the length of the original square cloth 'L'. Since it is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the length of the trimmed piece is L - 4.

The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of the trimmed piece is:

Area = (L - 4) \* (L - 4) = L^2 - 8L + 4

Since the piece is cut diagonally in half, the area of each half is:

Half area = (L^2 - 8L + 4) / 2

We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so:

Half area = 70

Solving for L, we get:

L = 58

The perimeter of the original square cloth is:

Perimeter = 2(L + 4) = 2(58 + 4) = 56 + 8 = 64

Answer Choices:
A) 20
B) 30
C) 40
D) 200
E) None
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the number of values of M that are more than 300, we need to find the number of values of M that satisfy the equation:

M > N + 396c

We know that N = cba, so we can write:

M > cba + 396c

Simplifying, we get:

M > 396c

Since M is a three-digit number, we know that it has at most 999 as its value. Therefore, we can say that:

396c < 999

Solving for c, we get:

c < 2

So, there are at most 2 values of c that satisfy the equation:

M > cba + 396c

Since M is a three-digit number, there are at most 10 possible values of M (001 to 999). Therefore, there are at most 10 x 2 = 20 values of M that are more than 300.

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say there are x students in the school.

We know that 20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 20% of x, which is 0.2x.

We also know that 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 28% of x, which is 0.28x.

We are given that 20% of the students took both physics and math, so the number of students who took both is 20% of the number of students who took physics, which is 0.2x.

We can set up the following system of equations:

0.2x + 0.28x = 100% (total number of students)
0.2x + 0.28x = 20% of x (students who took physics)
0.2x = 20% of x (students who took math)

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To form a square from a rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm, we need to first find the area of the rectangle.

The area of the rectangle is given by:

Area = length x breadth
= 27 x 17
= 469 cm^2

Now, we can see that the area of the square will be equal to the area of the rectangle, since the square has the same area as the rectangle.

So, the side of the square will be:

side = square root of area
= square root of 469
= 22 cm

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information we know:

* Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew.
* Each son receives five times as much as each nephew.
* The total amount to be divided is Rs 8600.

Now, let's find out how much each nephew receives:

Since each nephew receives four times as much as each daughter, each nephew receives 4/5 of the amount each daughter receives.

So, each nephew receives 4/5 of Rs 8600, which is:

4/5 x Rs 8600 = Rs 6600

Now, we can find out how much each daughter receives:

Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, each daughter receives 4 x Rs 6600 = Rs 2640.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) Rs 2640.",E

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say the youngest member is 7 years old, so the age of the next member would be 7 + 3 = 10, then the next member would be 10 + 3 = 13, and so on.

We know that the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we can set up an equation:

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + (250 - 7) = 250

Since the youngest member is 7 years old, the oldest member would be 250 - 7 = 243 years old.

So, the equation becomes:

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + 243 = 250

We can simplify this equation by finding the sum of the first 25 members:

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + 243 = 250

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + 243 = (10 x 25) + 7

B) 5 am on the next day
C) 5 pm on the next day
D) 2 pm on the next day
E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which two objects move relative to each other. In this case, we need to find the time at which the two trains meet each other, which is when their relative speed is zero.

Let's first find the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. We know that Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am and runs at a speed of 40 kmph, so it will cover the distance in:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 40 kmph x 4 hours (to Lucknow)
Distance = 160 km

Now, Train B leaves Mumbai Central at 2 pm and runs at a speed of 72 kmph, so it will cover the same distance in:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 72 kmph x 2 hours (to Lucknow)
Distance = 144 km

Since both trains are running on the same route, they will meet at the point where their distances are equal. In other words, they will meet when Train A has traveled 144 km and Train B has traveled 160 km.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

144 km = 40 kmph x Time + 160 km

Solving for Time, we get:

Time = (160 km - 40 km) / 40 kmph
Time = 2 hours

So, the two trains will meet at 2 pm.

The answer is:

C) 5 pm on the day.",A

E) 18
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

Mark told John that if he gives him half of his money, he will have Rs. 75.

So, if John gives Mark half of his money, John will be left with half of his original amount.

Now, John said that if Mark gives him one-third of his money, he will have Rs. 75.

So, if Mark gives John one-third of his money, Mark will be left with one-third of his original amount.

Let's assume that Mark had x amount of money to begin with.

If Mark gives John half of his money, Mark will be left with x/2.

If Mark gives John one-third of his money, Mark will be left with x/3.

We know that John will have Rs. 75 if Mark gives him half of his money or one-third of his money.

So, we can set up two equations:

Equation 1:

x/2 = 75

Equation 2:

x/3 = 75

Solving both equations, we get:

x = 22

So, John had Rs. 22.

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The number of water lilies on the lake doubles every two days, so if there were initially 64 water lilies on the lake, the number of water lilies after one day is:

64 x 2 = 128

After two days, the number of water lilies is:

128 x 2 = 256

Since it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, we can see that:

256 / 60 = 4

So, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 4 days.

D) y 2 / x 2 units
E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say x men can complete x units of work in x days, so the rate of work is x units per day.

If y men work for y hours per day, their rate of work is y units per day.

To find out how much work can be completed by y men in y days, we can multiply their rate of work by the number of days they work:

y units/day x y days = y^2 units

Now, we can compare this to the amount of work that x men can complete in x days:

x units/day x x days = x^2 units

Since x and y are different, we can set up a ratio to compare the two:

y^2 units / x^2 units = y / x

So, the answer is:

The answer is y / x

To form a quadrilateral by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F, we can choose any 4 of these points to form a quadrilateral. Since there are 5 points in total, there are 5C4 = 5 × 4 = 20 possible quadrilaterals.

However, we need to exclude the case where all four points are on the same side of the center point F, as that would form a rectangle rather than a quadrilateral. There are 4 such configurations, so we need to subtract them from the total number of possible quadrilaterals.

Therefore, the final answer is 20 - 4 = 16.

To solve this problem, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a semicircle is 180 degrees. Since minor arc AC is 160 degrees, the sum of minor arc AC and minor arc AD must be 180 degrees.

We know that minor arc BD is 150 degrees, so the sum of minor arc AC and minor arc BD is:

160 + 150 = 310 degrees

Since the sum of the three minor arcs is 310 degrees, the measure of minor arc AD is:

310 - 160 = 150 degrees

Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 150 degrees.",B

We can start by finding the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation:

40% of 75% = 30% (of the total employees) take a summer vacation

Now, we can find the percentage of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation:

20% of 75% = 15% (of the total employees) take neither a winter nor a summer vacation

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the depth of the canal, we need to use the formula for the area of a trapezium:

Area = (b1 + b2) \* h

where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides, and h is the height.

In this case, the parallel sides are 10 m and 6 m, so b1 = 10 m and b2 = 6 m. The height of the trapezium is the depth of the canal, so h = depth.

Now we can plug in the values and solve for h:

Area = (10 + 6) \* h
= 16 \* h
= 640

Solving for h, we get:

h = 640 / 16
= 40

So the depth of the canal is 40 meters.

B) 1500 pi
C) 1875 pi
D) 3000 pi
E) 7500 pi
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the distance traveled by a point on a circular path:

distance = circumference x time / revolutions per minute

We know that the fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, so the radius of the circle is 10 cm. We also know that the fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute.

First, we need to convert the time from seconds to revolutions:

30 seconds = 30 x 60 = 1800 revolutions

Now we can plug in the values we know into the formula:

distance = circumference x time / revolutions per minute
= 2 x π x (10 cm) x 1800 / 300
= 2 x π x 10 x 6
= 2 x π x 60
= 2 x π x 3.14 x 60

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To solve this problem, we can start by simplifying the expression for x:

x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

We can factor out the n^2 term and the 16 term:

x = (n^2 + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

Now, we can see that the numerator is always greater than or equal to 16, and the denominator is always greater than or equal to 4√n + 4. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

16 ≤ x ≤ (n^2 + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

We know that 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, so we can substitute these values into the inequality:

16 ≤ x ≤ (36^2 + 16) / (36 + 4√36 + 4)

Simplifying, we get:

16 ≤ x ≤ (1296 + 16) / (36 + 6√36 + 4)

Simplifying further, we get:

1. A starts the business with Rs. 40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs. 60,000.
3. C joins after some more time with Rs. 120,000.
4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs. 375,000.
5. C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share.

We can start by finding out how much profit was made in the first 2 months, when only A and B were in the business:

Profit in 2 months = (40,000 + 60,000) x 2 = 140,000

Now, we can find out how much profit was made after C joined the business:

Profit after C joined = (140,000 + 120,000) x 10 = 375,000

Since C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share, we can find out how much profit was made in the entire year:

Total profit in the year = 375,000 - 150,000 = 225,000

Now, we can find out how many months C joined the business after B:

Let's say C joined the business x months after B joined.

We know that the total profit in the year is 225,000, and C gets 150,000 as his share. So, the profit made by B and C together in the year is:

Profit made by B and C = 225,000 - 150,000 = 75,000

Since B joined with Rs. 60,000, we can find out how much profit he made in the year:

Profit made by B = 75,000 / 60,000 = 1.25

Therefore, B made a profit of 1.25 times his investment,",B

A) 8.75
B) 8.79
C) 8.75
D) 8.71
E) 8.72
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the area of the remaining paper, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the original square.

The area of each semi-circle is given by:

Area of semi-circle = (1/2)πr^2

where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the semi-circles are drawn as diameters, the radius is half the length of the side of the square, which is 20 cm.

So, the area of each semi-circle is:

Area of semi-circle = (1/2)π(20/2)^2 = π(400) = 800π

Now, we subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the original square:

Area of remaining paper = Area of square - 2(Area of semi-circle)
= 20^2 - 2(800π)
= 400 - 1600π
= 2400 - 1600π

A) 22.5
B) 84
C) 21
D) 24
E) 25
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the original number x.

If 30 is subtracted from x, the result is:

x - 30 = x - 30

Since x - 30 is one-third of x, we know that:

x - 30 = x / 3

So, x / 3 = x - 30

Now, we can simplify:

x / 3 = x - 30

x / 3 = x - 30

x = 3(x - 30)

x = 3x - 90

Now, we can simplify:

x = 3x - 90

x = 2x - 90

x = 2x - 90

To find 50% of the original number, we can multiply by 0.5:

0.5x = 0.5(2x - 90)

0.5x = 2x - 45

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The sum of the digits of the number is 17.
2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109.
3. If we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the same digits written in reverse order.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the original number. We know that the sum of the digits is 17, so the digits must be:

a + b + c = 17

where a, b, and c are the digits of the number.

We also know that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so we can write:

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

Now, let's subtract 495 from the number:

a + b + c + 495 = 109

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

a + b + c + 495 = (a + b + c)^2

Since the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, we can equate the two expressions:

a + b + c + 495 = (a + b + c)^2

Now, we can solve for a, b, and c:

a + b + c = 17

a + b + c + 495 = 109

Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get:

a = 3
b = 7
c = 8

So, the original number is:

How many senators of these can be considered Hoopsmot ' s ?
Answer Choices:
A) 18
B) 20
C) 22
D) 24
E) 26
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Based on the information provided, we can calculate the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's as follows:

Hoopsmot contributed $16,000 to the bribery pool, which is 60% of the total contribution ($16,000 / $26,000 = 0.6).

Smolapon contributed $4,000 to the bribery pool, which is 40% of the total contribution ($4,000 / $26,000 = 0.4).

The total number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot and Smolapon is 30.

To determine the number of senators that can be considered Hoopsmot's, we need to calculate the proportion of the total contribution that Hoopsmot made compared to the total number of senators influenced.

Proportion of Hoopsmot's contribution to total number of senators = (Hoopsmot's contribution / Total number of senators) x 100

= (16,000 / 30) x 100

= 53.33%

Therefore, the answer is:

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the two numbers x and y. We know that the difference between their squares is 256000, so we can write:

x^2 - y^2 = 256000

We also know that the sum of the numbers is 1000, so we can write:

x + y = 1000

Now we can solve the system of equations. First, we can square both sides of the first equation to get:

x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y)

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

x^2 - y^2 = 2x + 2y - y^2

Substituting the second equation, we get:

2x + 2y - y^2 = 256000

Now we can solve for x and y. First, we can subtract y^2 from both sides to get:

2x + 2y = 256000 - y^2

Now we can factor the left-hand side:

2x + 2y = (2x + y)(2x - y)

So we can rewrite the equation as:

2x + 2y = 2(x + y)

Now we can see that (x + y) = 1000, so we can solve for x and y:

x + y = 1000

x = 500
y = 500

C) 700 kilometers
D) 555 meters
E) 600 meters
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use the concept of relative speed to solve this problem.

Ram and Krishna are traveling at constant speeds of 20 m/s and 40 m/s, respectively. Since they are traveling in the same direction, we can find their relative speed by taking the difference of their speeds:

Relative speed = 40 m/s - 20 m/s = 20 m/s

Since Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds, we know that the distance between A and C is:

Distance = Speed x Time = 20 m/s x 10 s = 200 m

Now, we need to find the distance between B and C. Since Krishna is traveling at a speed of 40 m/s, we can find the distance he covers in 10 seconds:

Distance = Speed x Time = 40 m/s x 10 s = 400 m

Since Krishna covers 400 m in 10 seconds, the distance between B and C is half of that:

Distance between B and C = 400 m / 2 = 200 m

Now, we can find the total distance between A and B by adding the distance between A and C and the distance between C and B:

Total distance = Distance between A and C + Distance between C and B
= 200 m + 200 m
= 400 m

A) 80
B) 120
C) 240
D) 320
E) 360
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use algebra to solve this problem. Let x be the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. Since the store sold 80% of its inventory, it sold 80% of x golf balls.

We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold. Therefore, the number of white golf balls sold is also 80% of x.

Since the store started with 600 golf balls, the total number of golf balls sold is 600 x 0.8 = 480 golf balls.

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls sold is equal to the number of golf balls sold minus the number of white golf balls sold. Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls sold is:

480 - (600 x 0.2) = 480 - 120 = 360

So, the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day is:

360 / 0.8 = 450

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use the concept of constant speed and time. Both cars are traveling at a constant speed, so we can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

We know that the distance between the cars will be 15 miles, so we can set up the equation:

15 = 55 x time + 52 x time

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

15 = 107 x time

Now, we can solve for time by dividing both sides of the equation by 107:

time = 15 / 107

time = 0.14

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To calculate the percentage gain, we need to first calculate the total amount earned by the merchant by selling the oranges.

Total amount earned = Total weight of oranges x Price per kg
= 90 kg x Rs. 7.50 per kg
= Rs. 675

Now, we can calculate the percentage gain as follows:

Percentage gain = (Total amount earned - Cost price) / Cost price
= (Rs. 675 - Rs. 450) / Rs. 450
= (135 / 450) x 100
= 30%

D) 56 min
E) 55 min
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, so it takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B.

Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, so it takes 3 hours and 30 minutes to travel from City B to City A.

Now, we need to find when the two trains cross each other. We know that Train M leaves City A at 5 am, and Train N leaves City B at 7 am. So, we can calculate the time when the two trains cross each other as follows:

5 am (Train M leaves City A) + 4 hours (Train M travels from City A to City B) = 9 am (Train M reaches City B)

7 am (Train N leaves City B) + 3 hours and 30 minutes (Train N travels from City B to City A) = 10:30 am (Train N reaches City A)

Now, we can see that the two trains cross each other at:

9 am (Train M reaches City B) - 3 hours and 30 minutes (Train N travels from City B to City A) = 10:30 am

E) 5 minutes
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find out how long it will take Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile, we need to know their individual biking speeds and the distance they need to bike.

Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, so she will bike 1 mile in:

1 mile / 10 miles per hour = 0.1 hours

Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, so she will bike 1 mile in:

1 mile / 20 miles per hour = 0.05 hours

Since they need to bike a total of 1 mile, we can add their biking times together to find out how long it will take them to bike 1 mile together:

0.1 hours + 0.05 hours = 0.15 hours

Therefore, it will take Janice and Jennie a total of 0.15 hours, or 9 minutes, to bike 1 mile together.

Answer Choices:
A) 2.6 m
B) 3.9 m
C) 4 m
D) 4.2 m
E) 4.4 m
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the height of the room, we need to use the formula for the semi-perimeter of a rectangle, which is:

semi-perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width of the rectangle.

We are given that the height of the room is 2 times the semi-perimeter, so we can set up the equation:

height = 2(semi-perimeter)

We are also given that the width of the paper is 50 cm, and the cost of papering the walls is Rs. 2 per meter. Therefore, the area of the walls can be found by multiplying the width by the height:

area = width x height = 50 cm x height

We are also given that the total area of the walls is 15 sq. m, so we can set up the equation:

15 = area = 50 cm x height

Now we can substitute the value of the semi-perimeter into the equation:

15 = 50 cm x (2(semi-perimeter))

Simplifying, we get:

15 = 50 cm x (2(2(l + w)))

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

15 = 50 cm x (2(2(l + w)))

Simplifying further, we get:

15 = 50 cm x (2(2l + 2w))

Now we can solve for l:

l = 15/2(2) = 15/4 = 3.75 m

Therefore, the height of the room is:

height = 2(semi-perimeter) = 2(2(3.75)) = 3.9 m

So the answer is:

* If the coin lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, so the total amount Jonathan has given is 3 x 20 = $60.

Since neither Christopher nor Jonathan won or lost any amount, we can set up the following equation:

$40 = 20 x (heads amount) + 20 x (tails amount)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$40 = 20 x heads amount + 20 x tails amount

Subtracting $20 from both sides gives us:

$20 = heads amount + tails amount

Since Christopher and Jonathan did not win or lose any amount, the sum of the heads amount and tails amount must be equal to $20.

Therefore, the number of times the coin landed on heads is:

heads amount = $20 / 2 = 10

So, the answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) 144 km
B) 72 km
C) 126 km
D) 84 km
E) 48 km
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the situation:

1. Allen starts from X and goes to Y, so his distance traveled is XY = 54 kmph x time = 54 km.
2. Bob starts from Y and goes towards X, so his distance traveled is YX = 78 kmph x time = 78 km.
3. When Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X, so his total distance traveled is XY + XX = 2 \* 54 km = 108 km.
4. When Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y, so his total distance traveled is YX + YY = 2 \* 78 km = 156 km.
5. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, so Bob's total distance traveled is 156 km + 48 km = 204 km.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

XY + XX = 2 \* 54 km = 108 km
YX + YY = 2 \* 78 km = 156 km

We can simplify these equations by combining like terms:

XY + XX = 108 km
YX + YY = 156 km

Simplifying further, we get:

XY + XX = 108 km
YX + YY = 156 km

Solving for XY, we get:

XY = 108 km / 2 = 54 km

Now, we can find the distance between X and Y:

The answer is:

C) 126 km

Cost of repairing current tires: $40 x 1 year = $40

Now, we can calculate the average cost per year of the new tires:

Average cost per year of new tires = $720 / 4 years = $180 per year

Now, we can compare the average cost per year of the new tires to the cost of repairing the current tires:

Ratio of average cost per year of new tires to cost of repairing current tires = ($180 / $40) = 4.5

We know that the length of the shorter piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the longer piece, so the length of the shorter piece is x - 3.

We also know that the total length of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 3 = 20

D) $ 202
E) $ 200
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B) $ 618.

To calculate the interest accrued on the bond at maturity, we need to use the formula for compound interest:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is $5,000, the rate is 12% per year (or 6% per semester), and the time is 1 year (or 2 semesters).

So, we can calculate the interest as follows:

Interest = $5,000 x 12% x 2 = $1,200

Therefore, the total amount that Jerry will receive at maturity is the principal plus the interest:

Total = $5,000 + $1,200 = $6,200

So, the correct answer is B) $618.",B

E) 21
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's assume that Sachin's age 10 years back was x. Then, Ajay's age 10 years back was x/2.

We know that Sachin is twice as old as Ajay 10 years back, so we can write:

x/2 = Ajay's age 10 years back

Now, we know that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so we can write:

x + 10 = 40

We can solve these two equations to find Ajay's age 10 years back:

x/2 = Ajay's age 10 years back

x + 10 = 40

Solving for x, we get:

x = 25

So, Ajay's age 10 years back was 25/2 = 12.5 years old.

Therefore, Ajay's current age is:

Ajay's current age = Ajay's age 10 years back + 10

C) 3440
D) Can not be determined
E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the cost of gardening a 1-meter wide boundary around a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 meters, we need to first find the area of the boundary.

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

Area = Length x Width

Since the perimeter is given as 340 meters, we know that the length of the rectangle is 340 meters. So, we can set up the equation:

Area = Length x Width

Area = 340 x Width

Since the width is 1 meter, we can substitute this value into the equation:

Area = 340 x 1

Area = 340

Now, we know that the area of the boundary is 340 square meters. To find the cost of gardening this area at a rate of 10 per square meter, we can multiply the area by the rate:

Cost = Area x Rate

Cost = 340 x 10

Cost = 3400

E) 3.1
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

* 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels.
* The remaining 66% of revenue was from the sale of biographies.

We can calculate the revenue from the sale of biographies as follows:

66% of revenue = 0.66 x Total revenue

Since 34% of revenue came from novels, we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Total revenue = 0.34 x Total revenue + 0.66 x Total revenue

Now we can substitute the values we know:

Total revenue = 0.34 x Total revenue + 0.66 x Total revenue

0.34 x Total revenue = 0.34 x (Total revenue - 0.66 x Total revenue)

Simplifying:

0.34 x Total revenue = 0.34 x (Total revenue - 0.66 x Total revenue)

0.34 x Total revenue = 0.34 x (Total revenue - 0.66 x Total revenue)

Now we can solve for Total revenue:

Total revenue = 0.34 x Total revenue + 0.66 x Total revenue

0.66 x Total revenue = 0.66 x Total revenue - 0.34 x Total revenue

0.66 x Total revenue = 0.66 x Total revenue - 0.34 x Total revenue

Now we can solve for Total revenue:

Total revenue = 0.66 x Total revenue - 0.34 x Total revenue

The answer is:

Total revenue = 2.1 x Total revenue - 0.34 x Total revenue

D) 215.67
E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount, we need to calculate the amount of interest that will be paid on the invoice if the merchant pays it on the due date (4/30).

First, we need to calculate the amount of the interest:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is $20,000, the rate is the interest rate per year, and the time is 30 days (1/12 of a year).

Interest = $20,000 x (RATE) x (1/12)

Next, we need to find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money. To do this, we need to set up an equation:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

We know that the interest is $20,000 x (RATE) x (1/12), so we can set up the equation:

20,000 x (RATE) x (1/12) = (20,000 x 1/12) x (1/12)

Simplifying the equation:

RATE x (1/12) = (20,000 x 1/12) x (1/12)

RATE = 20,000 x 1/12 x 1/12

RATE = 20,000 x 1/144

RATE = 20,000 / 144

RATE = 144/20,000

RATE = 1/144

The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 1/144, or approximately 0.7058823529411765.

E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

1. The company produces very fine quality pens, so 10% of the produced pens are always defective and rejected before packing.
2. The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each.
3. The overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%.

We know that the total number of pens produced is 7200, and the total revenue is 7200 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000.

Since 10% of the pens are defective, the number of defective pens is 7200 x 10% = 720 defective pens.

The total cost of producing the pens is the total revenue minus the cost of the defective pens. So, the total cost is:

Total cost = Total revenue - Cost of defective pens
= Rs. 72,000 - Rs. 720
= Rs. 6,480

Now, we can calculate the manufactured cost of each pen:

Manufactured cost per pen = Total cost / Total number of pens

We know that x + y exceeds the sum of the digits by 18, so we can write:

x + y = 18 + 18

Simplifying, we get:

2x + y = 36

Since the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, we know that y = 2x.

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

2x + 2x = 36

Combining like terms, we get:

4x = 36

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given expression:

L(x,y) = [x]+[y]+[x+y]
R(x,y) = [2x]+[2y]

First, let's consider the case where x and y are both positive. Then, we have:

L(x,y) = [x]+[y]+[x+y] = [x] + [y] + [2x] + [2y] = 3[x] + 3[y]

R(x,y) = [2x]+[2y] = 2[x] + 2[y]

Since 3[x] + 3[y] = 2[2x] + 2[2y], we have:

L(x,y) = R(x,y)

So, the answer is A) L(x,y) = R(x,y).

Now, let's consider the case where x is positive and y is negative. Then, we have:

L(x,y) = [x]+[y]+[x+y] = [x] + [y] + [x] - [y] = 2[x] - [y]

R(x,y) = [2x]+[2y] = 2[x] + 2[-y] = 2[x] - 2y

Since 2[x] - 2y = 2[x] - [y], we have:

L(x,y) = R(x,y)

So, the answer is still A) L(x,y) = R(x,y).

Finally, let's consider the case where x is negative and y is positive. Then, we have:

L(x,y) = [x]+[y]+[x+y] = [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] = 2[x] + 2[y]

R(x,y) = [2x]+[2y] = 2[-x] + 2[y] = -2x + 2[y]

Answer Choices:
A) After 6 minutes
B) After 12 minutes
C) After 18 minutes
D) After 24 minutes
E) none
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) After 18 minutes.

To see why, let's analyze the intervals between the rings of the three bells:

Bell 1 rings every 36 seconds, so it will ring again after 36, 72, 108, 144, etc. seconds.

Bell 2 rings every 40 seconds, so it will ring again after 40, 80, 120, 160, etc. seconds.

Bell 3 rings every 48 seconds, so it will ring again after 48, 96, 144, 192, etc. seconds.

Since all three bells ring together at the start, we know that they will ring together again when their intervals align. We can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 36, 40, and 48 to find the next time they will all ring together:

LCM(36, 40, 48) = 18

So, the three bells will ring together again after 18 minutes. Therefore, the answer is C) After 18 minutes.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 21
B) 22
C) 20
D) 23
E) 24
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use similar triangles to solve this problem.

We know that the electric pole is 14 meters high and casts a shadow of 10 meters. So, we can draw a triangle with the electric pole as the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) and the shadow as the shorter leg.

The height of the tree can be found by drawing a second triangle with the tree as the hypotenuse and the shadow as the shorter leg.

Since the shadow of the tree is 15 meters, the length of the shorter leg of the tree's triangle is 15 meters.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the longer leg of the tree's triangle:

length of longer leg = sqrt(15^2 + height^2)

Substituting the values, we get:

length of longer leg = sqrt(225 + height^2)

Now, we can set up a system of equations using the two triangles:

height^2 + 10^2 = 14^2 (from the electric pole's triangle)
15^2 = height^2 + 10^2 (from the tree's triangle)

Solving the system of equations, we get:

height = 22

So, the height of the tree is 22 meters.

The answer is:

B) 15 dollars
C) 20 dollars
D) 18 dollars
E) 10 dollars
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, I can help you with that!

The answer is C) 20 dollars.

Here's how I arrived at that answer:

The orange costs 18 dollars, so if we multiply that by 2 (to get the price of two oranges), we get:

18 x 2 = 36

The pineapple costs 27 dollars, so if we multiply that by 3 (to get the price of three pineapples), we get:

27 x 3 = 81

The grape costs 15 dollars, so if we multiply that by 4 (to get the price of four grapes), we get:

15 x 4 = 60

Now, we add up the prices of all three fruits:

36 + 81 + 60 = 177

So, the total cost of all three fruits is 177 dollars.

Since the mango is not listed among the options, we can assume that it costs the same as the grape, which is 15 dollars. Therefore, the answer is C) 20 dollars.",B

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say the distance traveled is x km.

The car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr for 20 hours, so it covers:

x km = 60 km/hr x 20 hours

x km = 1200 km

Now, the car needs to cover the same distance in 10 hours, so it needs to travel at a speed of:

x km / 10 hours = 1200 km / 10 hours

x km/hr = 120 km/hr

The car gains a speed of:

C) 23 / 90
D) 5 / 18
E) 13 / 45
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the probabilities of each friend answering the question correctly:

1. Alan: He randomly guesses, so his probability of guessing correctly is 1/5, or 20%.
2. Roger: He cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, so his probability of answering correctly is 2/3, or 67%.
3. Peter: He performs the calculations and marks the answer, so his probability of answering correctly is 5/6, or 83%.

Now, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to find the probability that only Peter answers correctly, since the other two friends are not answering correctly through honest means.

The probability that only Peter answers correctly is:

P(Peter answers correctly) = 5/6

The probability that at least one of the other two friends answers correctly (either Alan or Roger) is:

P(at least one of Alan or Roger answers correctly) = P(Alan answers correctly) + P(Roger answers correctly)
= 1/5 + 2/3
= 3/10

The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is therefore:

P(question is answered correctly but not via cheating) = P(Peter answers correctly) - P(at least one of Alan or Roger answers correctly)

D) 8 %
E) 4 %
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The difference between simple interest and compound interest at the same rate for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is given by:

Simple Interest:

Principal = Rs. 5000
Time = 2 years
Rate of Interest = x%

SI = (5000 x x x 2) / 100

= (5000 x 2 x x) / 100

= 10,000 x x / 100

= 10,000 x 2 x / 100

= 20,000

So, the simple interest for Rs. 5000 for 2 years at an interest rate of x% is Rs. 20,000.

Compound Interest:

Principal = Rs. 5000
Time = 2 years
Rate of Interest = x%

CI = (5000 x (1 + x/100)^2) - 5000

= (5000 x (1 + x/100)^2) - 5000

= (5000 x (1 + x/100)^2) - 5000

= (5000 x (1 + x/100)^2)

= 5000 x (1 + x/100)^2

= 5000 x (1 + x/100)^2

= 5000 x (1 + x/100) x (1 + x/100)

= 5000 x (1 + x/100) x (1 + x/100)

= 5000 x (1 + x/100) x (1 + x/100)

= 5000 x (1 + x/100) x (1 + x/100)

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* The number of files infected by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
* 50% of the files are not infected by a virus.

We can start by finding the number of files infected by a virus:

Number of files infected by a virus = Total number of files x Percentage infected by a virus
= 250 x 50%
= 125

Now, we can find the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm:

Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm = Total number of files x Percentage infected by both
= 250 x (2.5 x 50%)
= 250 x 125
= 312

Now, we can find the number of files not infected by a worm:

Number of files not infected by a worm = Total number of files - Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm
= 250 - 312
= 48

E) None of these
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's assume that Mohan's share is x.

Since Sohan is 24 years old now, his share will be 5100 - x.

The father wants both sons to receive equal amount when they turn 26 years old, so we can set up the equation:

x + (5100 - x) = 26 x 4%

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 5100 = 26 x 4%

2x + 5100 = 104 x

Solving for x:

2x = 104 x - 5100

2x = 5300

x = 2650

So, Mohan's share is 2650.

* The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds.
* We want to find out how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain.

Now, let's think about how we can use the information we have to solve the problem. We know that the rate of the liquid passing through the drain is w/25 gallons per x seconds, so we can start by converting the rate to gallons per minute:

w/25 gallons/x seconds = (w/25) x (1 minute/60 seconds) = w/25 x 60

Now we have the rate in gallons per minute: w/25 x 60.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. We can do this by dividing the number of gallons by the rate:

y gallons / w/25 x 60 = y x 60 / w

Now we have the answer in minutes: y x 60 / w.

So, the answer is:

The answer is y x 60 / w.

E) 50 grams
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

* The coin made of alloy is 2 mm thick and has a diameter of 15 mm, so its volume is:

V = π x (2 mm) x (15 mm) = 30π mm³

* The weight of the coin is 30 grams, so the weight of the alloy is:

W = 30 grams

* The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver, so the weight of the aluminum is:

W_Al = W / 2 = 30 / 2 = 15 grams

* Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, so the weight of the silver is:

W_Ag = 2 x W_Al = 2 x 15 = 30 grams

Now, we can find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum:

W_Aluminum = W - W_Ag = 30 - 30 = 0 grams

So, the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum would be 0 grams.

x = 40 x 3 = 120

Now, we know that 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of x, so we can write:

10 - (2/3x) = 10 - (2/3(120)) = 10 - 80 = 20

So, the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number is 40 + 1/3(120) = 40 + 40 = 80.

Answer Choices:
A) 9
B) 7

D) 8
E) 12
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the largest integral value of 'k' for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots, we need to find the critical points of the function.

First, we can factor the equation as:

x^2 - 5x + k = (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0

This tells us that either (x - 3) = 0 or (x - 2) = 0.

Now, we can set each factor equal to 0 and solve for x:

1. x - 3 = 0 --> x = 3
2. x - 2 = 0 --> x = 2

So, we have two distinct real roots, x = 3 and x = 2.

To find the largest integral value of 'k' for which the roots are real and distinct, we need to find the largest value of k that satisfies the following conditions:

1. k > 0 (since we are looking for real roots)
2. k is an integer (since we are asked for the largest integral value of k)
3. The discriminant of the equation, b^2 - 4ac, is positive (since we want two distinct roots)

The discriminant of the equation is:

b^2 - 4ac = 5^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k

Since we want the discriminant to be positive, we need:

25 - 4k > 0

Simplifying, we get:

4k < 25

Solving for k, we get:

k < 6

So, the largest integral value of k for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots is k = 6.

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the amount of dog food in the bowl at 8:00 am x.

We know that the dog ate exactly once an hour, so the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food at each feeding session.

At 9:00 am, the dog ate 1/3 of x, so the amount of food left in the bowl is:

x - (1/3)x = x - (1/3)x = 2/3x

At 10:00 am, the dog ate another 1/3 of the remaining food, so the amount of food left in the bowl is:

2/3x - (1/3)x = 2/3x - (1/3)x = 1/3x

At noon, the dog ate the last 1/3 of the remaining food, so the amount of food left in the bowl is:

1/3x

We want to find out what percent of the original food was left in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon. To do this, we can divide the amount of food left in the bowl at noon by the original amount of food:

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. 60% of the people who took the survey were women.
2. 75% of the men who were surveyed preferred red cars over green cars.

We know that 60% of the survey takers were women, so the number of women who took the survey is 60% of the total number of survey takers. Let's call the total number of survey takers ""x"".

The number of women who took the survey is 60% of x, or 0.6x.

We also know that 75% of the men who were surveyed preferred red cars over green cars. Let's call the number of men who were surveyed ""y"".

The number of men who preferred red cars is 75% of y, or 0.75y.

We know that 10 men preferred green cars over red cars, so the number of men who preferred red cars is 10 less than the total number of men who were surveyed:

0.75y - 10 = y

Now we can set up an equation based on the information we have:

0.6x + 0.75y = 100

We know that x + y = 100, because there are a total of 100 survey takers.

Solving the system of equations, we get:

x = 50
y = 50

So there were 50 women and 50 men who took the survey.

Answer Choices:
A) 0.5
B) 1
C) 1.25
D) 1.5
E) 2
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to mix in enough orange juice to make the total amount of orange juice in the soft drink equal to 60% of the total volume of the soft drink.

Let's use the information that one gallon of the soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water.

So, the total volume of the soft drink is:

40% orange juice + 60% water = 100%

40% orange juice = 0.4 x 1 = 0.4 gallons
60% water = 0.6 x 1 = 0.6 gallons

Total volume of soft drink = 0.4 + 0.6 = 1 gallon

Now, we need to find out how much orange juice we need to add to make the total amount of orange juice in the soft drink equal to 60% of the total volume.

Let's say we want to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. We can do this by mixing in enough orange juice to make the total amount of orange juice in the soft drink equal to 60% of the total volume of the soft drink.

So, we need to mix in:

60% of 1 gallon = 0.6 x 1 = 0.6 gallons

of orange juice

Therefore, we need to mix in 0.6 gallons of orange juice to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

B) 2 / 5
C) 3 / 5
D) 4 / 5
E) 6 / 5
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B) 2/5.

To see why, let's consider the number of ways Mr. Jain could have selected the winning horse:

1. He could have selected the first horse, which has a 1/5 chance of being the winning horse.
2. He could have selected the second horse, which also has a 1/5 chance of being the winning horse.
3. He could have selected both horses, which has a 1/10 chance of being the winning horse (since there are two horses).

Since Mr. Jain selected two horses at random, the probability that he selected the winning horse is the sum of the probabilities of selecting the first and second horses:

2/5 + 1/5 = 3/5

So, the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is 3/5.",B
217,"[INST] On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3 - digit number N , we get the same remainder . The sum of the digits of N is :
Answer Choices:
A) 10
B) 11
C) 12
D) 13
E) 14
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem:

When dividing 2272 by a 3-digit number N, the remainder is the same as when dividing 875 by N.

When dividing 2272 by N, we get:

2272 ÷ N = 2272 / N = 2272 ⌊N⌋ + 2272 ⌌N⌋

where ⌊N⌋ is the greatest integer less than or equal to N, and ⌌N⌋ is the remainder of N.

Since the remainder is the same as when dividing 875 by N, we know that:

2272 ⌊N⌋ + 875 ⌌N⌋ = 2272 ⌊N⌋ + 875 ⌌N⌋

Simplifying, we get:

2272N + 875 = 2272N + 875

Subtracting 2272N from both sides gives us:

875 = 875

Since the remainder is the same for both divisions, we know that N must be a multiple of 875.

Now, let's analyze the sum of the digits of N:

The sum of the digits of N is:

N = 10a + 10b + 10c

where a, b, and c are the digits of N.

Since N is a multiple of 875, we know that a, b, and c must be 0 or 5.

Therefore, the sum of the digits of N is:

N = 10a + 10b + 10c = 10(0) + 10(0) + 10(0) = 0

Answer Choices:
A) 44 %
B) 66 %
C) 68 %
D) 72 %
E) 75 %
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the percentage of students who passed, we need to first find the number of passing students and the number of failing students.

Let's use the information that the passing students had an average of 83 and the failing students had an average of 55.

The overall class average was 76, so we can set up the following equation:

(83 + 55) / 2 = 76

Simplifying the equation:

138 / 2 = 76

138 = 76 x 2

76 x 2 = 138

76 = 138 / 2

Now we can find the number of passing students:

83 + 55 = 138

138 - 55 = 83

83 / 2 = 41.5

Rounding up to the nearest whole number:

42 passing students

Now we can find the number of failing students:

138 - 83 = 55

55 / 2 = 27.5

Rounding down to the nearest whole number:

27 failing students

Now we can find the percentage of students who passed:

Answer Choices:
A) $ 83
B) $ 92
C) $ 90
D) $ 97
E) $ 104
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the wage on the 8th day, we need to find the average wage for the first 7 days and the last 7 days separately.

For the first 7 days, the average wage is $87 per day, so the total wage for the first 7 days is:

7 days x $87 per day = $603

For the last 7 days, the average wage is $92 per day, so the total wage for the last 7 days is:

7 days x $92 per day = $654

Total wage for the fortnight = $603 + $654 = $1257

Since the total wage for the fortnight is $1257, the wage on the 8th day would be:

$1257 / 15 days = $83.80 per day

So, the answer is:

B) $83

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say the two original numbers are x and x + 3, where x is the smaller number.

According to the problem, the ratio of the two numbers is 3:5, so we can write:

x + 3 : (x + 3) + 9 = 3:5

Now, when we subtract 9 from each number, we get:

x + 3 - 9 : (x + 3 + 9) - 9 = 3:5

Simplifying, we get:

12 : 23 = 3:5

Now, we can see that the smaller number is x + 3, which is equal to 12.

Answer Choices:
A) 40
B) 60
C) 70
D) 80
E) 90
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by understanding the given information:

* Ajay's present age is x years old.
* If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, the remainder is divided by 18.
* The result of this operation gives Rahul's present age.
* Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis, who is 5 years old.

Now, let's work out the problem step by step:

1. First, subtract 6 years from Ajay's present age:

x - 6 = ... (remainder)

Since the remainder is divided by 18, we can write:

(x - 6) / 18 = Rahul's present age

2. Now, we can simplify the division:

(x - 6) / 18 = (x - 6) x 18 / 18

= x - 6

So, Rahul's present age is equal to Ajay's present age minus 6.

3. Since Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis, we can write:

Rahul's present age = Ajay's present age - 6 - 2

= Ajay's present age - 8

4. Finally, we can substitute the value of Ajay's present age:

Ajay's present age - 8 = ...

Since Ajay is 40 years old, we can substitute:

40 - 8 = ...

= 32

So, Rahul's present age is 32 years old.

B) 81
C) 126
D) 252
E) None
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's call the length of the unpainted side x.

The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can write:

2(painted sides) + x = 37

Since each painted side has a length of 9 feet, we can write:

2(9) + x = 37

Simplifying, we get:

18 + x = 37

Subtracting 18 from both sides gives us:

x = 19

So the length of the unpainted side is 19 feet.

The area of the parking space is:

Area = length x width

where width is the sum of the lengths of the painted sides.

Width = 2(9) + x

Width = 2(9) + 19

Width = 18 + 19

Width = 37

Area = 19 x 37

Area = 733

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's say the weight of the original crew member who is replaced is x kg.

The average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat is:

(x + 53 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9) / 10 = 530 kg / 10 = 53 kg

When the original crew member is replaced by a new man, the average weight of the crew changes to:

(x + 53 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 + new_man) / 10 = 530 kg / 10 + new_man

We are given that the average weight of the crew increases by 1.8 kg, so we can set up the equation:

530 kg / 10 + new_man = 530 kg / 10 + 1.8

Simplifying the equation, we get:

new_man = 530 kg / 10 + 1.8

Solving for new_man, we get:

new_man = 530 kg / 10 + 1.8
= 530 kg / 10 + 18

= 53 kg

Therefore, the weight of the new man is 53 kg.

So, the total number of ways to select two balls without choosing the ball with number 3 is:

n x (n-1) = n(n-1)

Now, we are given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls without choosing the ball with number 3. So, we can set up the equation:

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find out how much B bottles of soda will cost in dollars, we need to know the cost of 1 bottle of soda.

The problem states that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, so we can set up the equation:

27 x cost per bottle = A cents

We know that the cost per bottle is A cents, so we can solve for A:

A = 27 x cost per bottle

A = 27 x (unknown)

Now we can substitute the value of 27 bottles into the equation:

27 x cost per bottle = 27 x A

27 x A = A cents

To find the cost of 1 bottle, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

cost per bottle = total cost / number of bottles

cost per bottle = A cents / 27

Now we can solve for A:

A = 27 x cost per bottle

A = 27 x (A cents / 27)

A = (27 x A cents) / 27

A = 2700 / 27

A = 100

So the cost of 1 bottle of soda is $1.

The answer is:

B) 27 / AB

Explanation:

We are given that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents, so we can set up the equation:

27 x cost per bottle = A cents

We know that the cost per bottle is A cents, so we can solve for A:

A = 27 x cost per bottle

A = 27 x (unknown)

Now we can substitute the value of 27 bottles into the equation:

27 x cost per bottle = 27 x A

27 x A = A cents

To find the cost of 1 bottle, we can divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

cost per bottle = total cost / number of bottles

cost per bottle = A cents / 27

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 180.

To count the number of different groups of presenters, we need to choose 4 presenters from a team of 8 people (4 men and 4 women). Since we cannot choose a group of only men or only women, we need to choose at least one man and at least one woman for each group.

There are 8C4 = 8 x 7 x 6 x 5 = 180 possible combinations of 4 presenters.

So, there are 180 different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team.",B
238,"[INST] Exactly 2 / 5 th of the children in a certain class are girls . If there are 100 boys in the class , how many girls are in the class ?
Answer Choices:
A) 50
B) 100
C) 150
D) 200
E) 70
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use the information that exactly 2/5 of the children in the class are girls. This means that the number of girls is 2/5 of the total number of children in the class.

We know that there are 100 boys in the class, so the total number of children in the class is:

100 + 2/5(100) = 100 + 2\*20 = 100 + 40 = 140

Therefore, there are 140 children in the class.

Now, we can find out how many girls are in the class by multiplying the total number of children by the fraction of girls:

140 x 2/5 = 140 x 2 = 280

So, there are 280 girls in the class.

The answer is: C) 280.",C
239,"[INST] Two numbers are said to be relatively prime if they share no common positive factors other than 1 . Set S contains the set of integers from 1 to 1,000 , inclusive . What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 ?
Answer Choices:
A) 5 / 7
B) 3 / 5
C) 4 / 7
D) 2 / 5
E) 2 / 7
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To determine the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of relatively prime pairs in S.

A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not have any common factors with 1,000 other than 1. In other words, the only common factor between the two numbers is 1.

Let's count the number of pairs of numbers in S that have no common factors other than 1:

1 and 2 have no common factors other than 1.
1 and 3 have no common factors other than 1.
1 and 4 have no common factors other than 1.
...
1 and 999 have no common factors other than 1.

There are 1000 pairs of numbers in S that have no common factors other than 1.

Therefore, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is:

1000/1000 = 1

C) $ 54
000
D) $ 59
000
E) $ 62
000
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the original amount of money that Charles invested, we can use the formula for compound interest:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(n\*t)

Where:
A = the future value of the investment (the amount Charles received)
P = the principal (the amount originally invested)
r = the annual interest rate (8% in this case)
n = the number of times the interest is compounded per year (semi-annually, so n = 2)
t = the time the money is invested (1 year in this case)

We know that A = $54,080, so we can set up the equation:

P(1 + 8/2)^(2\*1) = $54,080

Simplifying and solving for P, we get:

P = $54,080 / (1 + 8/2)^(2\*1)
= $54,080 / (1.04)^(2\*1)
= $54,080 / 1.08
= $49,500

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father . Find the age of Joe ' s father ?
Answer Choices:
A) 45
B) 48
C) 50
D) 55
E) 58
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. Joe's age, his sister's age, and their father's age sum up to 100.
2. When Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now.
3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as her father.

From point 1, we know that Joe's age + his sister's age + their father's age = 100.

From point 2, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now. So, if Joe is x years old, his sister will be 2x years old.

From point 3, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as her father. So, if Joe is x years old, his father will be 2x - x = x years old.

Now, let's solve for x:

1. Joe's age + his sister's age + their father's age = 100

Joe's age + 2x + their father's age = 100

3x + their father's age = 100

Since their father's age is not explicitly given, we can let it be x + 100.

3x + (x + 100) = 100

4x + 100 = 100

4x = 0

x = 25

So, Joe is 25 years old, and his sister is 50 years old (2x). Their father is 50 + 100 = 150 years old.

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by analyzing the given information:

""One third of 3/4 of a number is 21.""

We know that 3/4 of a number is equal to 3 x 4/4 = 3 x 1 = 3.

So, one third of 3/4 of a number is equal to 3 x 1/4 = 3 x 3/4 = 3 x 21/4 = 21.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

21 = 3 x 21/4

To solve for the number, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

84 = 3 x 21

Therefore, the number is 84.

To find the percentage of x in terms of y, we can divide x by y:

x/y = (m/100 * 4y)/y

Simplifying, we get:

x/y = m/100

So, the answer is:

The answer is m/100.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) y/400.",D

B) 32.8 %
C) 43.7 %
D) 59.0 %
E) 65.6 %
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 43.7%.

To calculate this, we can use the binomial distribution formula:

P(exactly 4 voted) = (5 choose 4) \* P(voted in last election) ^ 4 \* (1 - P(voted in last election)) ^ 1

where P(voted in last election) = 0.9 (since there is a 90% chance that a registered voter voted in the last election).

Plugging in the values, we get:

P(exactly 4 voted) = (5 choose 4) \* 0.9^4 \* 0.1^1 = 43.7%

So, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election is 43.7%.",E
246,"[INST] Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced . If the yard has an area of 240 square meters , how many meters of fencing does she need ?
Answer Choices:
A) 58
B) 62
C) 66
D) 70
E) 74
End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the area of the yard, we need to multiply the length of one side by the length of the other side. Let's call the length of one side ""L"" and the length of the other side ""W"".

The area of the yard is given as:

Area = L x W

We know that one side (the 10-meter side) is unfenced, so we can set up an equation:

L + W = 240

Since we want the area to be 240 square meters, we can solve for L and W:

L = 240 - W

Substituting W = 10, we get:

L = 240 - 10

L = 230

Now we can find the length of the other side:

W = L + 10

W = 230 + 10

W = 240

So the length of the other side is 240 meters.

To find the amount of fencing needed, we need to add up the lengths of all three sides:

Fencing needed = L + W + W

Fencing needed = (230 + 240 + 240)

Fencing needed = 670

The answer is:

The answer is C) 66 meters of fencing.",A

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To find the sum of three consecutive integers whose product can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729, we can start by finding the product of the three consecutive integers:

727 x 728 x 729 = 37 x 38 x 39

We can see that the product of the three consecutive integers is 37 x 38 x 39, which is equal to 37 x 39 x 38.

Now, we can find the sum of the three consecutive integers by adding 727 + 728 + 729:

727 + 728 + 729 = 37 + 39 + 38

The sum of the three consecutive integers is 37 + 39 + 38, which is equal to 84.

Since the distance is the same as the driving distance (20 km), we can use that as the distance for the cycling trip as well.

The worker cycles at an average rate of 6 km/h, so we can plug that into the formula as the speed:

Time = 20 km / 6 km/h

Time = 3.33 hours

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the time to minutes:

Time = 3.33 hours x 60 minutes/hour

Time = 200 minutes

End your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the situation:

P eating alone would take 10 minutes to finish the jar, so P's eating rate is 10/60 = 1/6 candies per minute.

Q eating alone would take 5 minutes to finish half the jar, so Q's eating rate is 5/60 = 1/12 candies per minute.

Since both are eating simultaneously, we need to find the common denominator of their eating rates. The least common multiple of 6 and 12 is 12, so we can convert their eating rates to:

P's eating rate: 1/6 = 2/12
Q's eating rate: 1/12 = 2/12

Now, we can find the total eating rate of both:

Total eating rate = P's eating rate + Q's eating rate
