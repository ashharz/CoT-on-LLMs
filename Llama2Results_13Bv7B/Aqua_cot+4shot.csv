C) 7 ( √ 3 – 1)
D) 8 ( √ 3 – 2)
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The car is driving in a straight line towards the base of the tower, so the angle of elevation is changing uniformly.
2. The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, which means the angle of depression (the angle between the line of sight and the horizon) changes from 45° to 60°.
3. We know that the angle of depression is equal to the angle of elevation of the tower above the horizon.
4. Since the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, the angle of depression changes from 45° to 60°.
5. We can use trigonometry to find the height of the tower. The height of the tower is equal to the tangent of the angle of depression.

So, the height of the tower is:

height = tan(60°) ≈ 1.58

Now, we need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower. We know that the car is moving at a uniform speed, so the time taken to cover a distance is directly proportional to the distance traveled.

Let's call the distance between the car and the tower ""d"". The time taken to reach the tower is:

time = d / speed

We know that the car is moving at a uniform speed, so the speed is constant. Let's assume the speed is ""s"".

Now, we can set up the equation:

d = speed x time

Substituting the values, we get:

d = s x time

We know that the distance between the car and the tower is 100 meters (since the tower is 100 meters tall).

So, we can substitute the values:

d = s x time
100 = s x time

Now, we can solve for time:

time = d / s
time = 100 / s

We know that the speed of the car is 60 km/h (since it's a straight line and the speed is constant).

So, we can substitute the value:

s = 60 km/h

E) $ 78.20
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item.
2. The discounted price of the item was 22% of the original price.
3. The customer used a $20-off coupon.
4. There is no tax on the item.

Now, let's find the original price of the item.

First, we can find the discounted price of the item by multiplying the original price by the discount percentage (22%):

Original price x 22% = Discounted price

Next, we can find the amount the customer paid by subtracting the discounted price from the amount the customer paid ($20 - off coupon):

Customer paid - Discounted price = Amount paid

Now, we can find the original price by dividing the amount paid by the discount percentage (22%):

Amount paid / 22% = Original price

Solving for the original price, we get:

$1.90 / 22% = $8.60

So, the original price of the item was $8.60.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out together.

We know that the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74.

We want to find the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. This means we need to find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.

To do this, we can use the Inclusive OR rule, which states that the probability of either event A or event B occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring.

So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month is:

P(neither) = P(A does not increase) + P(B does not increase)

We know that the probability that Stock A does not increase is 1 - 0.56, which is 0.44.

We know that the probability that Stock B does not increase is 1 - 0.74, which is 0.26.

So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month is:

P(neither) = 0.44 + 0.26 = 0.68

E) 315
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

We know that the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, so the selling price is 100% + 20% of the cost price.

The selling price is Rs. 360, so we can set up the equation:

100% + 20%(cost price) = 360

Now, we can solve for the cost price:

100% + 20%(cost price) = 360

20%(cost price) = 360 - 100%

20%(cost price) = 360 - 100

20%(cost price) = 260

Now, we can find the cost price:

Cost price = 20%(260)

Cost price = 260 x 20/100

Cost price = 52

C) 12.5
D) 13.5
E) 15
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The train starts at a speed of 100 miles/hour and covers a distance of 1/4 of the total distance in 1 hour.
2. The train then slows down to 75 miles/hour and covers the remaining distance.

We can let the total distance be x miles, so the distance covered in 1 hour at 100 miles/hour is 1/4x, and the distance covered in 1 hour at 75 miles/hour is (x-1/4x) = 3/4x.

Since the train takes 10 hours to reach its destination, we can set up the following equation:

100x + 75(3/4x) = 10

Simplifying the equation, we get:

3/4x + 75x = 10

Combine like terms:

4x + 75x = 10 + 75x

11x = 85

x = 85/11

x = 7.7

So, the total distance is 7.7 x 100 = 770 miles.

The answer is C) 12.5 hours.

The train takes 10 hours to cover 3/4 of the distance, and 2.5 hours to cover the remaining 1/4 of the distance, for a total journey duration of 12.5 hours.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, which means that 45% of 200 is at least 90 students (since 90 is more than 45% of 200).
2. At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, which means that 35% of 200 is at least 70 students (since 70 is more than 35% of 200).
3. Since there are only 200 students in total, we can deduce that the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is the difference between the total number of students and the sum of the students who attended the prom night and the debating session:

Maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session = 200 - (90 + 70)

Let X be the number of sales of $250 each that the salesperson must make to reach a salary of at least $1000.

We know that the salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale, so the total amount earned from each sale is 10% of $250, which is $25.

So, the total amount earned from X sales is:

X x $25 = $25X

We also know that the salesperson must earn at least $1000, so we set up the equation:

$25X >= 1000

Simplifying the equation, we get:

X >= 40

So, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we know that the company sells all 420 components every month, so the total revenue from sales is 420 x $226 (the minimum selling price per component) = $93,520 per month.

Next, we know that the production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost per month is 420 x $110 = $46,200.

Now, we can calculate the yearly profit as follows:

Yearly profit = 12 x ($93,520 - $46,200) = $626,400

E) 5
000
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so 10% of the total number of staplers produced on Monday were defective.
* 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so 2% of the total number of non-defective staplers were rejected.

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. Since these staplers were not defective, we can infer that they were part of the 90% of staplers that were not defective.

So, the number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday is 90% of the total number of staplers produced on Monday, which is:

90% x (total number of staplers) = 90% x (72 + x)

where x is the total number of staplers produced on Monday.

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can substitute 72 for the x in the above equation:

90% x (72 + x) = 90% x 72 + 90% x x

Simplifying the equation:

72 + 90% x = 90% x + 72

Subtracting 72 from both sides:

90% x = 72

Dividing both sides by 90%:

x = 72 / 90%

x = 800

So, the total number of staplers produced on Monday is 800.

1. The word ""PROBLEC"" has 7 letters.
2. To make a 7-letter word without any repetition, we need to choose 7 letters from the 8 letters of the word.
3. Since we cannot choose the same letter twice, the number of ways to choose 7 letters is 8 x 7 = 56.
4. However, we have to exclude the word ""PROBLEC"" itself, since it is not a valid 7-letter word.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that A and B are independent events, so the probability of A given B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of A (P(A)), since the occurrence of B does not affect the probability of A.

We also know that P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8.

So, P(A|B) = P(A) = 0.2.

Now, we can find P(A/B) using the formula:

P(A/B) = P(A) / P(B)

C) 3 step / minute
D) 4 step / minute
E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. If you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes. This means that the distance between each step is 20/10 = 2 meters.
2. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes. This means that the distance between each step is 10/20 = 0.5 meters.

Now, let's think about the speed of the elevator. The speed of an object is defined as the distance traveled per unit of time. In this case, we know that the distance traveled is the number of steps times the distance between each step.

If you walk 20 steps and stop, the distance traveled is 20 x 2 = 40 meters. Since you reach the bottom in 10 minutes, the speed is 40/10 = 4 meters per minute.

If you walk 10 steps and stop, the distance traveled is 10 x 0.5 = 5 meters. Since you reach the bottom in 20 minutes, the speed is 5/20 = 0.25 meters per minute.

Now, we need to find the speed of the elevator. Since you walk 20 steps and stop, the speed of the elevator is 4 meters per minute. Since you walk 10 steps and stop, the speed of the elevator is 0.25 meters per minute.

Therefore, the answer is:

The speed of the elevator is 4 meters per minute when you walk 20 steps and stop, and 0.25 meters per minute when you walk 10 steps and stop.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we know that the average score for the entire class is y, and the average score for the highest and lowest scorers is x. We also know that there are z students in the class, where z > 5.

First, let's find the average score for the highest and lowest scorers. We know that the average of two scores is (x + y) / 2.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

(x + y) / 2 = x + y

Simplifying, we get:

x + y = 2(x + y)

Solving for x, we get:

x = y - 1

Now, we can find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. We know that the average score for the class is y, and the average score for the highest and lowest scorers is x. So, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:

(zy - 2x) / (z - 2)

Simplifying, we get:

(zy - 2x) / (z - 2) = (zy - 2y) / (z - 2)

= (y - 2y) / (z - 2)

= (0) / (z - 2)

= 0

So, the answer is:

If he sells each bag for $ 100 and makes $ 3,000 in profit , how many bags did he sell ?
Answer Choices:
A) 12
B) 16
C) 24
D) 30
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

First, we know that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour. This means that for every bag of flour he sells, he earns a profit of 25% of the selling price.

We also know that the grocer makes a total profit of $3,000. This means that the total profit he earns from selling all the bags of flour is $3,000.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation. Let's say the grocer sells x bags of flour. The equation for the total profit he earns can be written as:

Profit = (25% of selling price) x number of bags

We know that the selling price of each bag is $100, so the equation becomes:

Profit = (25% of $100) x number of bags

Profit = $25 x number of bags

Since the grocer makes a total profit of $3,000, we can set up the equation:

$25 x number of bags = $3,000

Now, we can solve for the number of bags by dividing both sides of the equation by $25:

Number of bags = $3,000 / $25

Number of bags = 120

So, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so he makes 35 toys in 7 hours, which means he makes 35/7 = 5 toys per hour.
2. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he makes 35 toys in 9 hours, which means he makes 35/9 = 4 toys per hour.
3. Since both Alex and Jacob have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that they have worked for the same number of hours, let's call it x hours.
4. Alex makes 5 toys per hour, so he makes 5x toys in x hours.
5. Jacob makes 4 toys per hour, so he makes 4x toys in x hours.
6. Since they have worked for the same number of hours, the total number of toys made by Alex and Jacob is the same, so we can set up the equation:

5x = 4x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

So, Jacob has worked for 4 hours.

Now, we can find out how many toys Jacob has made:

Jacob makes 4 toys per hour, so he makes 4 x 4 = 16 toys in 4 hours.

D) 22.35 %
E) 32.51 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. First, we know that John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk, so he replaces 15% of 50% = 0.5 x 0.15 = 7.5% of the original tea with milk.
2. Next, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution (which is now 50% - 7.5% = 42.5%) with more milk. So, he replaces 10% of 42.5% = 4.25% of the original tea with milk.
3. Now, we need to calculate the final concentration of tea that John drinks. To do this, we need to add up all the percentages of milk that John has added to the original tea.

The answer is:

C) 39.86%

Explanation:

The original tea was 50% strong milk tea, so it had a concentration of 50% = 0.5.

After replacing 15% of the original tea with milk, the concentration of milk increased by 7.5% = 0.075.

After replacing 10% of the resultant solution with more milk, the concentration of milk increased by 4.25% = 0.0425.

Therefore, the final concentration of tea that John drinks is:

0.5 + 0.075 + 0.0425 = 0.5 + 0.075 + 0.0425 = 0.6225 = 39.86%

E) 6780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1/16 of the students study math, so there are 16x1/16 = 1/2 students studying math.

1/10 of the students study bio, so there are 10x1/10 = 1/2 students studying bio.

1/8 of the students study english, so there are 8x1/8 = 1/2 students studying english.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we know that the sum of the number of students studying each subject must be a multiple of 10.

Let's assume that the total number of students is x. Then, we can write the equation:

x = 16x + 10x + 8x = 34x

Simplifying, we get:

x = 34x = 34(1/2) = 17

So, there are 17 students in the class.

Now, let's find the maximum and minimum number of students studying each subject:

Maximum number of students studying math: 16x = 16(17) = 272

Minimum number of students studying math: 16x - 1 = 16(17) - 1 = 271

Maximum number of students studying bio: 10x = 10(17) = 170

Minimum number of students studying bio: 10x - 1 = 10(17) - 1 = 169

Maximum number of students studying english: 8x = 8(17) = 136

Minimum number of students studying english: 8x - 1 = 8(17) - 1 = 135

Now, we can find the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students studying each subject:

Maximum - Minimum = 272 - 271 = 1

Maximum - Minimum = 170 - 169 = 1

Maximum - Minimum = 136 - 135 =",A

D) 228 km
E) 128 km
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey, so the distance = speed x time = (speed) x 6 hours.
2. In the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so the new speed = old speed + 12 km/hr = (old speed) + 12 km/hr.
3. The jeep takes 4 hours to cover the same distance in the return journey, so the distance = new speed x time = (new speed) x 4 hours.

Now, let's substitute the values we know:

distance = (old speed) x 6 hours = (new speed) x 4 hours

We know that the old speed is 127 km/hr, and the new speed is 127 km/hr + 12 km/hr = 139 km/hr.

So, the distance = (127 km/hr) x 6 hours = (139 km/hr) x 4 hours

The answer is:

C) 127 km

C) 36 %
D) 40 %
E) 42 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, the original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost, which means the retail price was:

Retail price = Wholesale cost x 1.6

Now, we know that the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so the sale price was:

Sale price = Retail price x 0.8

We can substitute the value of the retail price into the equation for the sale price:

Sale price = (Wholesale cost x 1.6) x 0.8

Simplifying, we get:

Sale price = Wholesale cost x 1.28

So, the appliance was sold for 1.28 times its wholesale cost. To find the percentage increase over the wholesale cost, we can divide by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100:

Percentage increase = (Sale price / Wholesale cost) x 100

Percentage increase = (1.28 / 1) x 100

Percentage increase = 128%

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

From the problem statement, we know that the rectangular sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set of sides, and a perimeter of 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.

We can start by finding the length and width of the sheet. Let's call the length of the sheet x cm, and the width y cm.

Since the perimeter of the sheet when folded along one set of sides is 48 cm, we can set up the following equation:

x + y + x + y = 48

Similarly, since the perimeter of the sheet when folded along the other set of sides is 66 cm, we can set up the following equation:

2x + 2y + x + y = 66

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Solving the system of equations, we get:

x = 30 cm
y = 20 cm

Now that we have the dimensions of the sheet, we can find its area using the formula:

Area = length x width = 30 x 20 = 600 cm^2

The answer is C) 600 cm^2.",B

Answer Choices:
A) Rs . 697.50

C) Rs . 787.50
D) Rs . 750
E) Rs . 780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given that the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5% and earns Rs. 15 less as profit, we can let the marked price of the watch be x. Then, the selling price after a 5% discount is:

x - (5/100)x = x - 0.05x = x - 0.05x

Since the shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit, we know that the difference between the selling price and the marked price is 15:

x - 0.05x = x - 0.05x + 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.05x = 15

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.05 to solve for x:

x = 15 / 0.05

x = 300

So, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 300.

Now, if the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, we can use the same approach to find the new selling price:

x - (7/100)x = x - 0.07x = x - 0.07x

Since the shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit, we know that the difference between the selling price and the marked price is still 15:

x - 0.07x = x - 0.07x + 15

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.07x = 15

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.07 to solve for x:

x = 15 / 0.07

x = 214.29

So, the marked price of the watch after a 7% discount is Rs. 214.29.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given that the student found the value of 7/18 of a number, we know that the actual value of 7/8 of the number is different from the student's answer by 770.

Let's call the number x. Then, we can write the student's answer as 7/18 of x, which is:

7/18x

Since the actual value of 7/8 of x is different from the student's answer by 770, we can set up the equation:

7/18x - 7/8x = 770

Simplifying the equation, we get:

1/18x - 1/8x = 770/8

Multiplying both sides by 8, we get:

1/18x = 770

Now, we can divide both sides by 18 to solve for x:

x = 770/18

C) $ 30000
D) $ 20000
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The fixed salary of the shop assistant is $500, so we know that:

S = 500 + (5/100) \* (monthly sales)

2. We want the monthly salary to be $1500, so we set up an equation:

S = 1500

3. Substituting the expression for S from step 1 into the equation, we get:

1500 = 500 + (5/100) \* (monthly sales)

4. To find the monthly sales that will give us a salary of $1500, we can solve for the variable (monthly sales) in the equation:

500 + (5/100) \* (monthly sales) = 1500

5. Now we can solve for the monthly sales by subtracting 500 from both sides of the equation:

(5/100) \* (monthly sales) = 1000

6. To find the monthly sales, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 100 to get rid of the fraction:

Monthly sales = 100 \* (5/100) \* (monthly sales)

7. Now we can simplify the equation:

Monthly sales = 100 \* 5

8. Finally, we can solve for the monthly sales:

Monthly sales = 50000

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The plane flies along the four sides of a square, so it covers four sides of the square.
2. The speeds of the plane are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr.
3. We can find the total distance covered by the plane by adding the distances of each side of the square:

Distance = 200 km/hr x 1 side + 400 km/hr x 2 sides + 600 km/hr x 3 sides + 800 km/hr x 4 sides

Distance = 200 + 2 x 400 + 3 x 600 + 4 x 800

Distance = 200 + 800 + 1800 + 3200

Distance = 6000 km

1. Now, we can find the average speed of the plane by dividing the total distance by the time taken to cover that distance:

Average Speed = Distance / Time

Average Speed = 6000 km / 4 sides

Average Speed = 1500 km/hr

The answer is C) 1500 km/hr.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total.
2. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners.
3. So, the cost of 1 white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of 1 brown sharpeners.
4. The total cost of 18 sharpeners is 100 rupees.

Now, let's find out how many white and brown sharpeners Jack bought.

Let x be the number of brown sharpeners.

Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners, the cost of x white sharpeners is x + 1 rupees.

The total cost of x brown sharpeners and x white sharpeners is:

x + (x + 1) = 2x + 1

Since the total cost is 100 rupees, we can set up the equation:

2x + 1 = 100

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 99

x = 49

So, Jack bought 49 brown sharpeners.

Now, we can find out how many white sharpeners Jack bought:

x + 1 = 49 + 1 = 50

So, Jack bought 50 white sharpeners.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given information:

The number is 5 digits long, and with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.

So, if we place a 1 before the number, it would be 3 times smaller, so the original number must be 3 times the number with a 1 before it.

Now, let's try different possibilities:

If the number with a 1 before it is x, then the original number would be 3x.

So, we need to find a number x that satisfies the condition that 3x is 5 digits long and has the same digits as the original number.

Let's try some examples:

If x = 1000, then 3x = 3000, which has 5 digits and is the correct length, but the digits are not the same as the original number.

If x = 2000, then 3x = 6000, which has 5 digits and is the correct length, but the digits are not the same as the original number.

If x = 3000, then 3x = 9000, which has 5 digits and is the correct length, and the digits are the same as the original number!

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that 24% of all students at Daifu University are members of both the chess club and the swim team.
2. We also know that 20% of the members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.
3. So, to find the percentage of students who are members of the swim team, we need to subtract the percentage of students who are not members of the chess club from the total percentage of students who are members of both clubs.

The answer is:

C) 40%

Explanation:

24% of all students are members of both clubs, and 20% of the members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. So, the total percentage of students who are members of the swim team is:

24% + (100% - 20%) = 24% + 80% = 40%

Therefore, 40% of all Daifu University students are members of the swim team.",B

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The population of the city increases by 5% annually, which means that the population in the first year will be:

Current population + (5% of current population)
= 78000 + (5% of 78000)
= 78000 + 3900
= 81900

So, the population in the first year is 81900.

Now, to find the population in 2 years, we need to add the increase in population for the second year:

81900 + (5% of 81900)
= 81900 + 4095
= 86095

Therefore, the population of the city in 2 years will be 86095.

B) 1.25
C) 1.50
D) 1.75
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's call the time it takes for the first car to travel 50 miles ""t"". Since the cars start at the same time, we know that the second car will start t minutes after the first car.

We know that the first car travels at 12 mph, so it will cover 50 miles in:

50 miles / 12 mph = t minutes

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 12:

12(50/12) = t

This simplifies to:

600 = 12t

Now, we can solve for t by dividing both sides by 12:

t = 600 / 12

t = 50

So, the first car will travel 50 miles in 50 minutes. Since the second car starts 50 minutes after the first car, it will take:

50 minutes + 50 minutes = 100 minutes

Therefore, the second car will meet the first car 100 minutes after they begin.

C) 1.50

D) 50000
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The servant's monthly salary is 1500.
2. The servant is also entitled to a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.
3. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

1500 + (15% of monthly sale) = 6000

We can simplify the equation as follows:

1500 + (15% of monthly sale) = 1500 + (0.15 x monthly sale)

Now, we can solve for the monthly sale:

1500 + (15% of monthly sale) = 1500 + (0.15 x monthly sale)

1500 + 15% of monthly sale = 1500 + 0.15 x monthly sale

1500 + 15% of monthly sale = 1500 + 0.15 x monthly sale

To find the monthly sale, we can divide both sides of the equation by 15%:

1500 + 15% of monthly sale = 1500 + 0.15 x monthly sale

1500 + 15% of monthly sale = 1500 + 0.15 x monthly sale

Now, we can solve for the monthly sale:

1500 + 15% of monthly sale = 1500 + 0.15 x monthly sale

1500 + 15% of monthly sale = 1500 + 0.15 x monthly sale

The answer is:

So, the man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. To find the interest rate, we need to find the total amount paid by the borrower over the 12 months.

Total amount paid = 12 x Rs. 31.50 = Rs. 378

Now, we can find the interest rate by dividing the total amount paid by the original amount borrowed:

Interest rate = (Total amount paid - Original amount borrowed) / Original amount borrowed

Interest rate = (Rs. 378 - Rs. 360) / Rs. 360

Interest rate = Rs. 18 / Rs. 360

Interest rate = 18/360 = 1/20

Interest rate = 5%

Let x be the number of 25 paise coins, y be the number of 50 paise coins, and z be the number of one rupee coins.

We know that the total amount of money in the pouch is Rs. 700, so we can set up the equation:

x + y + z = 700

We also know that the total number of coins is equal to the total amount of money, so:

x + y + z = 700

Now, we know that the value of all the coins is:

25 paise coins x 25 = 625
50 paise coins x 50 = 2500
1 rupee coins x 1 = 1000

So, the total value of all the coins is:

625 + 2500 + 1000 = 4125

Now, we can set up a system of linear equations using the information we have:

x + y + z = 700

x + 25y + 100z = 4125

We can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the second equation for z:

z = 4125 - 25y - x

Now, we can substitute this expression for z into the first equation:

x + y + (4125 - 25y - x) = 700

Now, we can simplify and solve for x:

x + y + 4125 - 25y - x = 700

x + y - 25y = 700

y = 286

Now, we can find x:

x = 700 - 286 = 414

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 400 25 paise coins, 286 50 paise coins, and 414 one rupee coins",C

D) Rs . 3937.50
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

We know that the man spends Rs. 3500 per month, and he saves 12 1/2% of his income. To find his monthly income, we can use the following formula:

Income = Spending + Savings

In this case, his spending is Rs. 3500, and his savings is 12 1/2% of his income, which is:

Savings = 12 1/2% x Income

Now, we can substitute the values we know into the equation:

Savings = 12 1/2% x Income

Savings = 12 1/2% x (Income - Spending)

Savings = 12 1/2% x (Income - 3500)

Savings = 12 1/2% x (Income - 3500)

Now, we can solve for Income:

Income = Savings + Spending

Income = 12 1/2% x (Income - 3500) + 3500

Income = 12 1/2% x Income - 3500

Income = 12 1/2% x (100% x Income) - 3500

Income = 12 1/2% x Income - 3500

Now, we can simplify the equation:

Income = 12 1/2% x Income - 3500

Income = 12 1/2% x (100% x Income) - 3500

Income = 12 1/2% x Income - 3500

Income = 12 1/2% x Income - 3500

Now, we can solve for Income:

Income = 12 1/2% x Income - 3500

Income = 12 1/2% x (100",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can paint 1/6 of the contract in 6 days.
2. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can paint 1/8 of the contract in 8 days.
3. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can paint 1/12 of the contract in 12 days.
4. After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, so Mr. Black starts working for the remaining 8 days.
5. Mr. Black works for 6 days, so he can paint 6/8 of the contract.
6. Mr. Blue finishes the remaining 6 days of the contract, so he can paint 6/12 of the contract.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days it will take to complete the contract:

1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 3/24 + 3/8 + 3/12 = 3/24 + 3/8 + 3/12 = 15/24 + 3/8 + 3/12 = 18/24 + 3/8 + 3/12 = 21/24 + 3/8 + 3/12 = 24/24 = 1

2. The thickness of the cube is 1 cm, so the volume of the smaller cubes is 1^3 = 1 cubic centimeter.
3. Since the cube is hollow, the volume of the smaller cubes that are inside the cube is 125 - 1 = 124 cubic centimeters.
4. The outer surface of the cube is painted, so the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is the number of faces of the cube minus the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are inside the cube.
5. The number of faces of the cube is 6 (front, back, left, right, top, and bottom).
6. The number of faces of the smaller cubes that are inside the cube is 6 (the same as the cube).

D) Can not be determined
E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

R is as much younger than Q as Q is older than T.

We know that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years.

Let's assume that R's age is x years, and T's age is y years.

We can write the equation based on the given information:

x + y = 50

Since R is younger than Q, we know that Q's age is x + 1.

So, we can write another equation:

x + (x + 1) = 50

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 1 = 50

Subtracting 1 from both sides:

2x = 49

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 24

So, R's age is 24 years, and T's age is 24 + 1 = 25 years.

Now, we can find the difference between R and Q's age:

Q's age = x + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25

R's age = x = 24

The difference between R and Q's age is:

25 - 24 = 1 year

The answer is:

B) 27

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is 1 year.",D

We know that Sachin's current batting average is 51, and he scores 78 runs in the finals. To find his new batting average, we need to divide his score by the number of innings he played:

New Batting Average = (78 / x)

where x is the number of innings played.

We know that Sachin's new batting average is 54, so we can set up the equation:

54 = (78 / x)

To solve for x, we can divide both sides by 78:

x = 78 / 54

x = 14

So, Sachin played 14 innings in the season.

D) 63 m
E) 64 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by given information:

A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1 m more than the 4 times the breadth.

Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. Then, the length of the rectangular piece is 4x + 1 meters.

We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the width is x meters, and the length is 4x + 1 meters.

So, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is:

2(4x + 1 + x) = 2(5x + 1)

Simplifying, we get:

2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2

Now, we know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m, so we can set up the equation:

10x + 2 = 150

Solving for x, we get:

10x = 148

x = 148/10

x = 14.8

So, the breadth of the rectangular piece is 14.8 meters.

Now, we can find the length of the rectangular piece:

4x + 1 = 4(14.8) + 1

4x + 1 = 59.2 + 1

4x = 58.2

x = 58.2/4

x = 14.55

So, the length of the rectangular piece is approximately 14.55 meters.

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source , how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins ?
Answer Choices:
A) 8.5
B) 10.5
C) 12.5
D) 14.5
E) 16.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

We know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how much of the health food we need to eat to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to first find out how much of each vitamin is present in 1 gram of the health food.

Let's start with vitamin E. We know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, so we can set up the following equation:

9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E = 1 gram of vitamin E

We can find the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E by looking at the reference daily intake (RDI) values. The RDI for vitamin E is 15 mg per day.

So, we can set up the following equation:

15 mg of vitamin E per day = 0.09 x <amount of vitamin E in 1 gram of health food>

Now, we can solve for the amount of vitamin E in 1 gram of health food:

0.09 x <amount of vitamin E in 1 gram of health food> = 15 mg

Amount of vitamin E in 1 gram of health food = 15 mg / 0.09 = 166.67 mg

Now, let's move on to vitamin A. We know that 1 gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. We can set up a similar equation to find the amount of vitamin A in 1 gram of health food:

8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A = 1 gram of vitamin A

The RDI for vitamin A is 900 mcg per day. So, we can set up the following equation:

900 mcg of vitamin A per day = 0.08 x <amount of vitamin A in 1 gram of health food>

Now, we can solve for the amount of vitamin A in 1 gram of health food:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
2. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
3. 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes are needed in total.

Now, let's think about how many large cakes and small cakes we need:

20 large cakes x 2 per hour = 40 large cakes
700 small cakes x 35 per hour = 24,500 small cakes

Since we need a total of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, we can see that we need a total of:

40 large cakes + 24,500 small cakes = 24,540 cakes

Now, we need to find out how many helpers we need to make this many cakes. Let's think about how many cakes each helper can make per hour:

For large cakes: 2 per hour
For small cakes: 35 per hour

So, if we have x helpers, we can make:

20 large cakes: x large cakes per hour x 3 hours = 6 x 3 = 18 large cakes
700 small cakes: x small cakes per hour x 3 hours = 35 x 3 = 105 small cakes

Now, we can see that we need a total of 18 large cakes and 105 small cakes, which means we need:

18 large cakes / 2 per hour = 9 helpers for large cakes
105 small cakes / 35 per hour = 3 helpers for small cakes

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 12 helpers.

We need 9 helpers to make the 18 large cakes and 3 helpers to make the 105 small cakes, for a total of 12 helpers.",B

Answer Choices:

B) 20 %
C) 25 %
D) 33 %
E) 18 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, the shopkeeper had a discount of 20% on all items for one day, which means that if an item originally cost $100, it would have been sold for $80 (20% of $100).

Now, the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at the original price the next day. This means that he needs to increase the price of the items by the amount of the discount, which was 20%.

So, to find the new price of an item that was originally $100, we can multiply it by 1 + (20%/100), which is:

$100 x (1 + (20/100)) = $100 x 1.2 = $120

So, the new price of the item is $120.

To find the percentage increase, we can divide the new price by the original price and multiply by 100:

($120 - $100) / $100 x 100 = 20%

So, the answer is A) 21%. The shopkeeper must increase the price of the items by 21% to original to make up for the 20% discount that was given the previous day.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem:

1. The bus fare for two persons for traveling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare for one person.
2. The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train between the two places is Rs. 1512.

Now, let's use this information to find the train fare for one person. We know that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so we can start by finding the train fare for one person and then multiplying it by 2 to get the bus fare for two persons.

The train fare for one person is:

F = Rs. 1512 / (6 + 8) = Rs. 1512 / 14 = Rs. 108

So, the train fare for one person is Rs. 108.

Now, we can find the bus fare for two persons by multiplying the train fare for one person by 4/3:

B = 4/3 x Rs. 108 = Rs. 144

Therefore, the bus fare for two persons is Rs. 144.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have a straight picket fence composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

We know that the length of the fence is equal to the sum of the length of each picket, so we can start by finding the length of one picket.

The length of one picket is 1/2 inch, so we can convert this to feet by dividing by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

1/2 inch / 12 = 0.04 feet

Now, we know that there are x pickets, so we can multiply the length of one picket by x to find the total length of the fence:

0.04 x x = length of fence

We also know that there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, so we need to subtract this from the total length of the fence:

length of fence = 0.04 x x - 6

Now, we can simplify this expression by multiplying both sides by 24 (since there are 24 inches in a foot):

24 x length of fence = 24 x (0.04 x x - 6)

Simplifying further, we get:

24 x length of fence = 0.04 x x - 12

Now, we can solve for the length of the fence by subtracting 12 from both sides:

24 x length of fence = 0.04 x x - 12

24 x length of fence = 0.04 x x - 12

Now, we can divide both sides by 24 to solve for the length of the fence:

length of fence = (0.04 x x - 12) / 24

Now, we can simplify this expression by subtracting 12 from both sides:

length of fence = (0.04 x x) / 24 - 12 / 24

length of fence = 0.04 x x / ",E

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The ship travels 180 miles, so the distance it has traveled is 180 miles.
2. The plane starts with 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10 x 180 miles/hour = 1800 miles/hour.
3. To find the distance the plane travels, we can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate (speed), and t is the time. Since the plane travels for the same amount of time as the ship, we can use the time the ship took to travel 180 miles:

d = rt
d = 1800 miles/hour x time

4. We know that the plane starts 10 times the speed of the ship, so the time the plane takes to travel the same distance is:

time = 180 miles / (10 x 180 miles/hour) = 18 miles/hour

5. Now we can find the distance the plane travels:

d = rt
d = 1800 miles/hour x 18 miles/hour = 324 miles

The answer is C) 324 miles.",C

B) 500
C) 5000
D) 6000
E) 7500
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we know that 20 deer out of 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year, which means that the proportion of deer with tags in 2002 is 20/500, or 1/25.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total deer population in the forest had tags during 2002. We know that 300 deer were caught and tagged in 2001, so the total number of deer in the forest in 2001 was 300 + (300 x 1/25) = 300 + 12 = 312.

Since the percent of deer with tags in 2002 is the same as the percent of deer with tags in 2001, we can use the proportion of deer with tags in 2001 to estimate the total number of deer in the forest in 2002.

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 5000.

Explanation:

We know that 20 deer out of 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year, which means that the proportion of deer with tags in 2002 is 1/25. Since the total number of deer in the forest in 2001 was 312, we can multiply 312 by 1/25 to find the total number of deer in the forest in 2002:

312 x 1/25 = 12.48

Rounding up to the nearest whole number gives us:

12.48 -> 13

So, the total number of deer in the forest in 2002 is approximately 13 x 500 = 5000.",E

D) 0.65
E) 1.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, so the first train on the main line starts at 5:00 AM.
2. The harbor line starts at 5:02 AM, so the first train on the harbor line starts 2 minutes after the main line train.
3. The man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: The man catches the main line train at 5:00 AM.
Scenario 2: The man catches the harbor line train at 5:02 AM.

Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

Scenario 1: The man catches the main line train at 5:00 AM.
Probability = 1/2 (since the main line train starts at 5:00 AM and runs every 10 minutes)
= 0.5

Scenario 2: The man catches the harbor line train at 5:02 AM.
Probability = 1/2 (since the harbor line train starts 2 minutes after the main line train and runs every 10 minutes)
= 0.5

Now, we need to find the probability of the man catching the first train. We can do this by adding the probabilities of both scenarios:

Probability of the man catching the first train = Scenario 1 + Scenario 2
= 0.5 + 0.5
= 1

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is A) 0.9.

So, the probability of the man catching the first train is 0.9 or 90%.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.
2. If the projection comes true, the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago.

Now, let's think about the population of Boomtown one year ago. If the population is expected to increase by 10% per year, then the population one year ago was 100% of the current population. So, the population of Boomtown one year ago is:

Population one year ago = Current population x 100%

Now, we know that the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago. So, we can set up the equation:

Population two years from now = Population one year ago x 2

Substituting the value of population one year ago, we get:

Population two years from now = (Current population x 100%) x 2

Simplifying, we get:

Population two years from now = Current population x 200%

Now, we can find the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year by dividing the population two years from now by the current population:

Percent population increase = (Population two years from now / Current population) x 100%

Substituting the values, we get:

Percent population increase = (Current population x 200%) x 100%

Simplifying, we get:

Percent population increase = 200%

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.

Now, let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have x + 30 dollars, and Arjun will have x - 30 dollars.
2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have x + 10 dollars, and Sajal will have y - 10 dollars.

Now, we can set up two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1:

x + 30 = 2y

Equation 2:

x + 10 = 3y - 10

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

Solving Equation 1 for x, we get:

x = 2y - 30

Now, substituting this expression for x in Equation 2, we get:

2y - 30 + 10 = 3y - 10

Simplifying, we get:

2y = 4y - 40

y = 20

Now, we can find the value of x:

x = 2y - 30

x = 2(20) - 30

x = 40 - 30

x = 10

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, which means that both numbers must be divisible by 11.

We also know that the least common multiple (LCM) of the two numbers is 7700. This means that both numbers must be divisible by the LCM, which is 7700.

Now, we know that one of the numbers is 350, so we can start by finding the multiples of 350:

350, 700, 1050, 1400, 1750, 2100, ...

As we can see, the multiples of 350 are all even numbers, and the first one that is divisible by 7700 is 700.

So, the other number must be 700 - 350 = 350.

Answer Choices:
A) 56
B) 58
C) 60
D) 62
E) 64
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. Since the triangles are similar, we can use the area formula for a triangle, which is:

Area = (base x height) / 2

Since the triangles are congruent, we can use the same base and height for both triangles. Let's call the base of each triangle ""b"" and the height ""h"".

So, the area of each triangle is:

Area = (b x h) / 2

We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

(b x h) / 2 = 70

Now, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to get:

b x h = 140

Since the triangles are similar, we know that the ratio of the base to the height is the same for both triangles. So, we can set up a proportion:

b/h = 140/70

Now, we can simplify this proportion by cross-multiplying and simplifying:

b x h = 140 x 70 / 2

b x h = 9800

Now, we know that the base of each triangle is b, and the height of each triangle is h. So, we can set up the equation:

b + b = 2 x h

Since the triangles are similar, we know that the sum of the bases is equal to twice the height. So, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to get:

2b = 2h

Now, we can solve for b by dividing both sides by 2:

b = h

Now, we know that the base of each triangle is equal to the height. This means that the triangles are equilateral triangles!

So, the perimeter of the original square cloth is equal to the perimeter of each triangle, which is:

Perimeter = 2 x (base + height)

Perimeter = 2 x (h + h)

Perimeter = 2 x 2h

Perimeter = 4h

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm, and it was reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that for every 5 units of length that were removed, 3 units were also removed.

To find the new length of the ribbon, we can start with the original length of 30 cm and subtract the amount that was removed. Since 5 units of length were removed for every 3 units of length that were removed, we can subtract 5/3 of the original length.

5/3 of 30 cm is 5 x 30 / 3 = 5 x 10 = 50 cm

So, the length of the ribbon after it was reduced is 30 cm - 50 cm = -20 cm.

The answer is C) 6 cm.",A

Answer Choices:
A) 20
B) 30
C) 40
D) 200
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

M = abc is a three-digit number and N = cba

M > N and M - N + 396c = 990

We know that M is a three-digit number, so it can be written as abcd.

We also know that N is a three-digit number, so it can be written as cba.

Now, let's analyze the equation M - N + 396c = 990:

M - N = abcd - cba = (a - c)(b - a)

Since M > N, we know that a - c and b - a are both positive. Therefore, we can write:

M - N = (a - c)(b - a) > 0

Now, we need to find the value of (a - c)(b - a) that makes the equation true.

We know that M - N + 396c = 990, so we can write:

(a - c)(b - a) + 396c = 990

Expanding the product, we get:

(a - c)(b - a) = 990 - 396c

Since M is a three-digit number, we know that a, b, and c are all non-zero digits. Therefore, we can divide both sides of the equation by (a - c) to get:

b - a = 990 / (a - c)

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

b - a = 990 / (a - c) = 990 / (3) = 330

Therefore, we have:

b = a + 330

Now, we can find the value of M:

M = abcd = (a + 330)(b + 330)(c)

Since M is a three-digit number, we know that a + 330, b + 330, and c are all non-zero digits. Therefore, we can divide each factor by (a + 330) to",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of students in the school.

We know that 20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 20% of x, which is 0.2x.

Similarly, 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 28% of x, which is 0.28x.

We also know that the total number of students is x.

Now, we can set up two equations:

0.2x + 0.28x = x (since 20% + 28% = 100%)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.48x = x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 550

The field is circular, and the cow is tethered in the middle with a 14 feet long rope. So, the distance from the cow to the edge of the field is 14 feet.

The cow grazes 10 square feet per day, so the area it grazes in one day is 10 square feet.

To find out how many days it will take for the cow to graze the whole field, we need to divide the area of the field by the area grazed per day:

Area of field = πr^2, where r is the radius of the field (half of the diameter)

Area of field = π(7) = 49π

Area grazed per day = 10 square feet

So, we can divide the area of the field by the area grazed per day:

49π / 10 = 4.9

Therefore, it will take the cow approximately 4.9 days to graze the whole field.

The answer is C) 71 days.",B

D) Rs . 1950
E) Rs . 1690
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. In the first month, 540 calls were made, and the bill was Rs. 1800.
2. In the second month, 620 calls were made, and the bill became Rs. 2040.
3. In the third month, 500 calls were made due to more holidays.

Now, let's analyze the pattern of the bill based on the given information:

The bill is party fixed and partly varies with the number of calls consumed. In other words, there is a fixed component and a variable component in the bill.

The fixed component is Rs. 1800 (as seen in the first month when 540 calls were made).

The variable component is the additional amount charged for each call made beyond the fixed component.

Now, let's calculate the variable component for each month:

1. In the first month, 540 calls were made, and the bill was Rs. 1800. So, the variable component is:

Variable component = Bill - Fixed component
= Rs. 1800 - Rs. 1800
= Rs. 0

2. In the second month, 620 calls were made, and the bill became Rs. 2040. So, the variable component is:

Variable component = Bill - Fixed component
= Rs. 2040 - Rs. 1800
= Rs. 240

3. In the third month, 500 calls were made, and the bill would be:

Variable component = Bill - Fixed component
= Rs. 1800 + (500 - 540) \* Variable component from previous month
= Rs. 1800 + (500 - 540) \* Rs. 240
= Rs. 1800 + Rs. 240 \* (500 - 540)
= Rs. 1800 + Rs. 240 \* 60

Answer Choices:
A) 1 hour and 31 minutes
B) 2 hour and 31 minutes
C) 3 hour and 31 minutes
D) 4 hour and 31 minutes
E) 5 hour and 31 minutes
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the circular track has a circumference of C, and the period of ball A is T. Then, we can write:

26 minutes = T x C / 2

where C is the circumference of the track.

Now, we know that ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so its period is:

35 minutes = 5 x T x C / 2

Now, we can equate the two expressions we just derived:

26 minutes = T x C / 2
35 minutes = 5 x T x C / 2

Solving for T, we get:

T = 26 / C

Now, we know that both balls start from the same point, so they will be at the same starting point again when they both complete one period. Therefore, we need to find when ball A will complete one period:

26 / C = 1

Solving for C, we get:

C = 26 x 2 = 52

Now, we know that the circumference of the track is 52, and the period of ball A is 26 minutes.

To find when ball B will be at the same starting point, we can use the fact that it takes 5 times as long for ball B to complete one period:

5 x 26 / C = 1

Solving for C, we get:

C = 5 x 26 = 130

Now, we know that the circumference of the track is 130, and the period of ball B is 35 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 3 hour and 31 minutes.

When ball A completes one period in 26 minutes, ball B will be at the same starting point after 35 minutes (5 times 26). Therefore, they will be at the same starting point again after 3 hour and 31 minutes.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. There are 30 hardcover books.
2. There are 20 fiction books.
3. We want to find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction.

Since a book can either be hardcover or fiction, but not both, we can start by counting the number of books that are neither hardcover nor fiction.

4. There are 45 books in total - 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books.
5. Subtract the number of hardcover books from the total number of books to find the number of books that are not hardcover: 45 - 30 = 15.
6. Subtract the number of fiction books from the number of books that are not hardcover to find the number of books that are neither hardcover nor fiction: 15 - 20 = 5.

So, there are 5 books that are neither hardcover nor fiction.

Now, we can find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction by adding the number of hardcover books to the number of fiction books:

30 (hardcover books) + 20 (fiction books) = 50.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let x be the number of friends who attended the picnic.

We know that the total amount spent on eatables was Rs 96, so the cost per person was Rs 96/x.

Since four friends did not show up, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs 4 extra each. So, the total cost for the remaining friends is:

Rs 96/x + Rs 4(x-4)

We want to find x, the number of friends who attended the picnic. To do this, we can set up the following equation:

Rs 96/x + Rs 4(x-4) = Rs 96

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x/4 + x - 4 = 96

Solving for x, we get:

x = 24

Answer Choices:
A) Rs 400
B) Rs 500
C) Rs 600
D) Rs 700
E) Rs 800
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let x be the amount each nephew receives. Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, the amount each daughter receives is 4x.

We know that the total amount the man has to distribute is Rs 8600. Let's distribute it among the sons, nephews, and daughters:

Sons: 5 sons x Rs 5 (since each son receives five times as much as each nephew) = Rs 25 per son x 5 sons = Rs 125

Nephews: 2 nephews x Rs 4x (since each nephew receives four times as much as each daughter) = Rs 4x per nephew x 2 nephews = Rs 8x

Daughters: 4 daughters x Rs 4x (since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew) = Rs 4x per daughter x 4 daughters = Rs 16x

Total amount distributed: Rs 125 + Rs 8x + Rs 16x = Rs 8600

Now we can solve for x:

Rs 8600 = Rs 125 + Rs 8x + Rs 16x

Subtracting Rs 125 from both sides gives us:

Rs 7350 = Rs 8x + Rs 16x

Adding Rs 8x and Rs 16x gives us:

Rs 7350 = Rs 24x

Dividing both sides by 24 gives us:

x = Rs 300

So each nephew receives Rs 300, and each daughter receives four times as much, or Rs 1200.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

Silu said, ""I weigh 51 Kgs.""

Meenu replied, ""I won't reveal my weight directly as I am overweight.""

But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.""

Now, let's think about what Meenu's statement means:

29 Kgs is a fixed weight, so we can ignore that for now.

Half of Meenu's weight is (1/2) \* Meenu's weight.

Since Meenu won't reveal her weight directly, we don't know what her weight is. However, we can use the information that she said ""plus half of my weight"" to infer that her weight is not an integer.

So, we can assume that Meenu's weight is a fraction, and half of her weight is (1/2) \* Meenu's weight.

Now, let's substitute the values we know:

Meenu's weight is 29 Kgs + (1/2) \* Meenu's weight

Simplifying, we get:

Meenu's weight is 29 Kgs + (1/2) \* (Meenu's weight)

Since Meenu's weight is not an integer, we can assume that it is a fraction with a whole number and a fractional part.

So, we can write:

Meenu's weight = 29 Kgs + (1/2) \* (whole number + fractional part)

Now, we can simplify further:

Meenu's weight = 29 Kgs + (1/2) \* (whole number) + (1/2) \* (fractional part)

Since the whole number is not known, we can ignore it for now.

So, we have:

Meenu's weight = 29 Kgs + (1/2) \* (fractional part)

Now, we can find the fractional part by dividing the weight by 2:

Meenu's weight = 29 Kgs + (1/2) \* (fractional part)

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start by identifying the common difference in the ages of the members:

Common difference = 3 months

Now, we know that the youngest member is 7 years old, so we can set up an equation based on that:

7 + (common difference x number of members) = 250

Substituting the common difference, we get:

7 + (3 x number of members) = 250

Now, we can solve for the number of members:

3x + 7 = 250

Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us:

3x = 243

Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:

x = 81

So, there are 81 members in the club.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. We know that Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am, so it will take:

11 am + 40 km/h = 12 noon

And Train B leaves Mumbai Central at 2 pm, so it will take:

2 pm + 72 km/h = 5 pm

Now, we know that both trains are running on the same route, so they will meet at the same distance from Mumbai Central. We can find this distance by subtracting the time it takes for Train A to reach Lucknow from the time it takes for Train B to reach Lucknow:

5 pm - 12 noon = 5 hours

Now, we know that the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is 5 hours x 72 km/h = 360 km.

So, Mark tells John that if he gives him half of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that Mark has twice the amount of money that John has.

Next, John says that if he gives Mark one-third of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that John has three times the amount of money that Mark has.

So, we can set up the following equation:

Mark's money = 2John's money

We know that Mark has Rs. 75, so we can set up the equation:

2John's money = 75

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for John's money:

John's money = 75/2

John's money = 37.5

C) x 3 / y 2 units
D) y 2 / x 2 units
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days.

We can start by writing down the information in a more general form:

xM xH/xD = xU

where M is the number of men, H is the number of hours worked per day, D is the number of days, and U is the number of units completed.

Now, we are given that y men working y hours per day can do the same amount of work in y days. We can write this as:

yM yH/yD = xU

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). We can use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the first equation for x:

x = xU/xH

Now, we can substitute this expression for x into the second equation:

yM yH/yD = xU

Substituting x = xU/xH, we get:

yM (yH/yD) (xU/xH) = xU

Now, we can simplify:

yM yH/yD = xU

Since yM and xM are equal, we can cancel them out:

yH/yD = xU/xH

Now, we can simplify further:

yH = xU/xH

Now, we have the answer:

The answer is xU/xH.

So, the amount of work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days is the same as the amount of work that x men working x hours per day can complete in x days, and that amount is xU/xH.

Therefore, the answer is A) x2/y2 units.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. We know that ABCDE is a regular pentagon, so all the sides are equal.
2. We are given that F is at the center of the pentagon.
3. We need to find the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Now, let's consider the different possible combinations of 4 points we can choose from the 5 points A, B, C, D, E, and F.

Combination 1: ABDF
Combination 2: ABCE
Combination 3: ACDF
Combination 4: ACDG
Combination 5: ADFG
Combination 6: BCEG
Combination 7: BDFG
Combination 8: CDFG

Since each combination can be formed in multiple ways (e.g., ABDF and ABCE are the same quadrilateral), we need to subtract the number of redundant combinations from the total number of combinations.

Redundant combinations:

* ABDF and ABCE (2 redundant combinations)
* ACDG and ADFG (2 redundant combinations)
* BCEG and BDFG (2 redundant combinations)

Total number of combinations: 8 - 2 - 2 - 2 = 4

E) 23
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by identifying the formula for the area of a trapezium:

Area = (b1 + b2) \* h

where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides, and h is the height of the trapezium.

In this case, we know that the width of the canal at the top is 10 m, and the width at the bottom is 6 m. So, we can let b1 = 10 and b2 = 6.

The height of the trapezium is not given directly, but we know that the area of the cross-section is 640 square meters. So, we can set up an equation based on that:

640 = (10 + 6) \* h

Simplifying this equation, we get:

640 = 16 \* h

Now, we can divide both sides by 16 to solve for h:

h = 640 / 16

h = 40

So, the depth of the canal is 40 meters.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan.
2. The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute.
3. We need to find the distance traveled by a point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds.

Now, let's convert the rate of revolutions per minute to revolutions per second:

300 revolutions/minute x (1 revolution/minute) / (100 seconds/minute) = 3000 revolutions/second

Now, we can use the formula for the distance traveled by a point on a circular path to find the distance traveled by the point on the fan blade:

distance = (revolutions x radius) / 2

In this case, the radius of the circular path is half of the distance between the center of the fan and the point on the edge of the fan blade, which is 10 centimeters.

So, the distance traveled by the point on the fan blade after 30 seconds is:

distance = (3000 revolutions x 10 cm) / 2
= 15000 cm

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the expression x = (n^2 + 2√n(n+4) + 16)/(n+4√n+4) to understand the conditions under which it satisfies the given range.

First, we can see that the expression is only defined for n ≥ 36, since the denominator (n+4√n+4) is always positive for n ≥ 36.

Now, let's look at the numerator:

n^2 + 2√n(n+4) + 16

For n = 36, this expression evaluates to:

36^2 + 2(36)(36+4) + 16 = 36^2 + 2(36)(40) + 16 = 36^2 + 96 + 16 = 144

So, x = 144/36 + 4 = 4.

For n = 72, this expression evaluates to:

72^2 + 2(72)(72+4) + 16 = 72^2 + 2(72)(76) + 16 = 72^2 + 168 + 16 = 240

So, x = 240/72 + 4 = 6.

Since n can take values between 36 and 72, the answer is:

What then is the length of the space shuttle ?
Answer Choices:
A) 50 m
B) 75 m
C) 100 m
D) 125 m
E) 150 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. We know that the space shuttle can travel 700 m high in 40 seconds, so its vertical velocity (upward) is:

700 m / 40 s = 17.5 m/s

2. We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so its horizontal velocity (forward) is:

5 s / 40 s = 0.125 m/s (since the horizontal velocity is 1/40th of the total velocity)

3. Now, we need to find the total length of the space shuttle. Since we know the vertical and horizontal velocities, we can use the formula for the total velocity:

v_total = v_vertical + v_horizontal

Substituting the values we have, we get:

v_total = 17.5 m/s + 0.125 m/s

v_total = 17.625 m/s

4. Finally, we need to convert the velocity from meters per second to meters. There are 1000 millimeters in a meter, so:

17.625 m/s x 1000 mm/m = 17625 mm/s

The answer is:

The length of the space shuttle is 17625 mm or 17.625 meters.

Answer Choices:
A) 2 months
B) 4 months
C) 23 months
D) 24 months
E) 84 months
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. A starts the business with Rs. 40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs. 60,000.
3. C joins them after some more time with Rs. 120,000.
4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs. 375,000.
5. C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share.

Now, let's think about the profit sharing ratio among A, B, and C. Since they are joining at different times, their profit sharing ratio will not be equal. We can let the profit sharing ratio of A, B, and C be x, y, and z respectively.

We know that the total profit is Rs. 375,000, so the total profit of A, B, and C is 375,000 x (1 + y + z) = 375,000 x 3 = 1,125,000.

Now, we can set up the following equation:

x + y + z = 1125000

Since C joins after B, so C's profit sharing ratio (z) will be greater than B's (y). Also, A's profit sharing ratio (x) will be the smallest since A started the business.

Now, we can solve the equation:

x + y + z = 1125000

x + y + 2y + z = 1125000

x + 3y + z = 1125000

Now, we can solve for z:

z = 1125000 - x - 2y

z = 1125000 - 40000 - 2 x 60000

z = 1125000 - 40000 - 120000

z = 1125000 - 160000

z = 965000

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we have a square paper with one side of length 20 cm, and two semi-circles are drawn on the opposite sides as diameters. If these semi-circles are cut off, what is the area of the remaining paper?

First, let's find the radius of the semi-circles. Since the semi-circles are drawn on the opposite sides of the square, the radius of each semi-circle is half the length of the side of the square, which is 20 cm. So, the radius of each semi-circle is 20/2 = 10 cm.

Now, we can find the area of each semi-circle using the formula for the area of a semi-circle: A = (1/2)r^2, where r is the radius. So, the area of each semi-circle is (1/2)(10)^2 = 100 cm^2.

Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is 2 x 100 = 200 cm^2.

Now, we need to subtract the area of the semi-circles from the area of the original square to find the area of the remaining paper. The area of the original square is 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2.

So, the area of the remaining paper is 400 - 200 = 200 cm^2.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
2. He turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
3. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.

We can start by finding out how long it took Kevin to drive from A to B at 70 mph:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = (70 miles) / (70 mph)

Time = 1 hour

Now, we know that Kevin spent 3 hours driving from A to B and back, so the total time he spent on the trip is:

Total Time = 3 hours + 1 hour

Total Time = 4 hours

We also know that Kevin was 70 miles away from B exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, so we can find out the distance between A and B:

Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = (90 mph) x (4 hours)

Distance = 360 miles

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

So, we know that 30 is subtracted from a number, and the result is reduced to its one-third. This means that the original number must have been a multiple of 30, and after subtracting 30, the result is a multiple of 10.

Now, 50% of the original number is the same as 50% of the result after subtracting 30. So, we can find 50% of the original number by finding 50% of the result after subtracting 30.

The result after subtracting 30 is a multiple of 10, so we can find 50% of the result by finding 50% of 10.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the man rows at a rate of x kmph in still water.

When he rows against the current, his rate is 2 kmph less than his rate in still water, so his rate against the current is x - 2 kmph.

We know that the man's total distance traveled, including both the distance he rows against the current and the distance he rows in still water, is equal to the distance he would have traveled if he had rowed in still water, plus the distance he rows against the current.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + (x - 2) = ?

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17.
* The sum of the squares of its digits is 109.
* Subtracting 495 from the number gives a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order.

Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17. This means that the digits must add up to 17.
2. The sum of the squares of its digits is 109. This means that the digits must be such that their squares add up to 109.
3. Subtracting 495 from the number gives a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order. This means that if we subtract 495 from the original number, the resulting number will have the same digits as the original number, but in reverse order.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the original number. We know that the sum of the digits of the original number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. This means that we can start by finding the digits of the original number and then checking if they satisfy the given conditions.

Let's assume that the original number is xyz, where x, y, and z are the digits. We know that the sum of the digits is 17, so we can write:

x + y + z = 17

We also know that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so we can write:

x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109

Now, let's subtract 495 from the original number to get the number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order:

x + y + z - 495 = 17

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x - 495 + y + z = 17

Now, we can solve for x, y, and z using the equations above. We have:

x - 495 + y + z = 17

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we have 40 grams of alloy X, which is made of zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9. That means that 40 grams of alloy X contains 6/15 * 40 = 24 grams of zinc and 9/15 * 40 = 21 grams of copper.

Similarly, we have 60 grams of alloy Y, which is made of zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11. That means that 60 grams of alloy Y contains 7/16 * 60 = 34 grams of zinc and 11/16 * 60 = 36 grams of copper.

Now, when we mix 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, we have a total of 100 grams of alloy Z. So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:

zinc in alloy Z = (24 + 34) / 100 = 58 / 100
copper in alloy Z = (21 + 36) / 100 = 57 / 100

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to the bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes $4,000.
2. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators.

Since Hoopsmot contributes more than twice as much as Smolapon, we can assume that Hoopsmot's contribution is the majority of the bribery pool.

Let X be the number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot.

Since Smolapon contributes $4,000, the total amount of money they have to influence 30 senators is:

$16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000

So, the cost of influencing each senator is:

$20,000 / 30 = $666.67

Since Hoopsmot contributes $16,000, he can influence:

$16,000 / $666.67 = 24

senators

Therefore, the answer is D) 24.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, and the sum of the numbers is 1000. We can start by writing down the equation based on the information given:

Let x be one of the numbers, and y be the other number.

We know that the difference between their squares is 256000, so we can write:

x^2 - y^2 = 256000

We also know that the sum of the two numbers is 1000, so we can write:

x + y = 1000

Now, we can solve for x and y. First, we can add x and y to eliminate one of the variables:

x + y = 1000

x + y = 1000

Now, we can substitute the expression for x^2 - y^2 into the equation:

x^2 - y^2 + x + y = 1000

Now, we can simplify the equation:

x^2 - y^2 + 2x + y = 1000

Now, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:

(x - y)(x + y) = 1000

Now, we can solve for x and y:

x - y = ±√(1000)

x + y = ±√(1000)

x = ±√(1000) ± y

So, the answer is:

The answer is ±628.

Therefore, the two numbers are 628 and 372, or -628 and 372.",B

We know that the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth, and on Venus, they would weigh 182 pounds. To find the percentage of the astronaut's weight on Earth that they would weigh on Venus, we can use the following formula:

(weight on Venus / weight on Earth) x 100

Plugging in the values we know, we get:

(182 / 211) x 100

Simplifying, we get:

(182 / 211) x 100

Answer Choices:
A) 2
B) 3
C) 4
D) 5
E) 6
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

The total income of the family per month is $9000.
The median income is $3000.

Since the median income is $3000, we know that half of the family's income is $3000.

To find the number of members in the family, we can use the fact that the sum of all incomes is equal to the total income:

Sum of all incomes = Total income

We can write this as:

3000 + x + x + ... + x = 9000

where x is the income of one person.

Since the sum of all incomes is $9000, we can set up the equation:

3000 + x + x + ... + x = 9000

We know that the sum of all incomes is $9000, so we can simplify the equation:

3000 + 5x = 9000

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 9000 / 5

x = 1800

Since the median income is $3000, we know that half of the family's income is $3000. So, the number of members in the family is:

Half of the family's income = 3000

Number of members in the family = 3000 / 1800

Number of members in the family = 2

Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds . Find the total distance between A to B .
Answer Choices:
A) 700 meters
B) 1000 meters
C) 700 kilometers
D) 555 meters
E) 600 meters
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time, so they both have the same initial distance from each other.
2. Ram travels at a speed of 20 m/s, and Krishna travels at a speed of 40 m/s.
3. They both travel in the same direction along the same route, so they are moving towards each other.
4. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the total distance between A and B. Since Ram meets Krishna at point C, we know that the distance between A and C is equal to the distance between C and B.

We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate (speed), and t is the time. Since Ram travels at a speed of 20 m/s, we know that his distance traveled in 10 seconds is:

d = rt = 20 m/s x 10 s = 200 m

Now, we need to find the distance between C and B. Since Krishna travels at a speed of 40 m/s, we know that his distance traveled in 10 seconds is:

d = rt = 40 m/s x 10 s = 400 m

Since the distance between A and C is equal to the distance between C and B, we can set up an equation:

200 m = 400 m + x

where x is the distance between A and B.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 200 m

Therefore, the total distance between A and B is 200 meters.

A) 80
B) 120
C) 240
D) 320
E) 360
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

Let's start with the information that the store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. We know that 80% of the inventory was sold, which means that 80% of 600 is the number of golf balls sold.

80% of 600 is the same as 0.8 x 600, which simplifies to 480.

So, the store sold 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of yellow golf balls sold must be equal to the number of white golf balls sold.

Let's find out how many white golf balls were sold. We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of white golf balls the store had.

The store had 600 golf balls in stock, and we know that 80% of the inventory was sold. So, the number of white golf balls the store had is 80% of 600, which simplifies to 480.

Therefore, the number of white golf balls sold is 480. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we know that the number of yellow golf balls sold is also 480.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Given:

* The flagstaff is 17.5 meters high (h)
* The shadow of the flagstaff is 40.25 meters long (l)

We know that the height of the building (b) is less than the height of the flagstaff, so we can set up an equation based on the similarity of triangles:

b \* l = h \* h

where l is the length of the shadow of the building, and h is the height of the building.

We are given that the shadow of the building is 28.75 meters long, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

b \* 28.75 = 17.5 \* 17.5

Now, we can solve for b:

b = 13.5 meters

Therefore, the answer is C) 13.5 meters.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 3 hours
B) 5 hours
C) 6 hours
D) 4 hours
E) 7 hours
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the distance between the cars at time t is x miles. Since they started at the same time and place, the distance between them is initially 0 miles.

The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, so its distance traveled per hour is 55 miles/hour. Therefore, after 1 hour, it will have traveled 55 miles.

The second car travels at a steady rate of 52 mph, so its distance traveled per hour is 52 miles/hour. Therefore, after 1 hour, it will have traveled 52 miles.

Since they started at the same time and place, the distance between them is equal to the difference between their distances traveled:

x = 55 - 52 = 3 miles

Since they are both traveling in the same direction, the distance between them will increase by 3 miles per hour. Therefore, after 2 hours, the distance between them will be:

x = 3 + (3 x 2) = 3 + 6 = 9 miles

Since they are 15 miles apart, it will take 9/15 = 0.6 hours for them to be 15 miles apart.

E) 8 : 3
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The volume of the cube is given as 3^3 = 27.

The volume of the sphere that fits inside the cube is given as 4/3 \* π \* r^3, where r is the radius of the sphere.

Since the sphere fits inside the cube, the radius of the sphere is less than or equal to the length of the cube's side. So, we can set up an inequality:

4/3 \* π \* r^3 <= 27

Now, we can simplify the left-hand side of the inequality:

4/3 \* π \* r^3 = 4/3 \* π \* (side length)^3

Since the side length of the cube is 3, we can substitute this value in:

4/3 \* π \* (3)^3 = 4/3 \* π \* 27

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side of the inequality:

27 = 27

So, the inequality becomes:

4/3 \* π \* r^3 <= 27

Now, we can divide both sides of the inequality by 4/3 \* π to get:

r^3 <= 27

Now, we can take the cube root of both sides of the inequality to get:

r <= 3

So, the radius of the sphere that fits inside the cube is less than or equal to 3.

Answer Choices:
A) 50 %
B) 60 %
C) 55 %
D) 70 %
E) 58 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's calculate the percentage gain of the merchant:

First, we need to calculate the cost price of one kilogram of oranges:

Cost price per kg = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5 per kg

Now, we can calculate the total revenue generated by selling all 90 kg of oranges:

Total revenue = 90 kg x Rs. 7.50 per kg = Rs. 675

Now, we can calculate the profit made by the merchant:

Profit = Total revenue - Cost price
= Rs. 675 - Rs. 5 per kg x 90 kg
= Rs. 675 - Rs. 450
= Rs. 225

Now, we can calculate the percentage gain:

Percentage gain = (Profit / Cost price) x 100
= (Rs. 225 / Rs. 450) x 100
= 50%

So, the answer is C) 55%.",A

C) 1 hr 8 min
D) 56 min
E) 55 min
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the situation:

1. Train M leaves City A at 5 am, so it takes 4 hours to reach City B (9 am - 5 am = 4 hours).
2. Train N leaves City B at 7 am, so it takes 3 hours to reach City A (10:30 am - 7 am = 3 hours).
3. Since both trains are traveling in opposite directions, they will meet at a point on the track.

Now, we need to find the point where the two trains cross each other. We know that Train M takes 4 hours to reach City B, and Train N takes 3 hours to reach City A, so the point of intersection is:

4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours

Therefore, the two trains cross each other at 7 hours after Train M leaves City A, which is:

7 hours + 5 am = 12 pm (noon)

So, the answer is:

B) 2 minutes
C) 3 minutes
D) 4 minutes
E) 5 minutes
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say Janice bikes for x minutes, and Jennie bikes for y minutes. We know that they bike at different speeds, so we can set up two equations:

10x + 20y = 1 (since they bike together for 1 mile)
x + y = 1 (since they bike for a total of 1 mile)

Now we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving the second equation for y:

y = 1 - x

Now, substitute this expression for y in the first equation:

10x + 20(1 - x) = 1

Expand and simplify:

10x + 20 - 20x = 1

-10x = -19

x = 2

Now we know that Janice bikes for 2 minutes, and Jennie bikes for 1 - 2 = 3 minutes.

Now, we can simplify the proportion:

504/M = 420/800

Multiply both sides by 800/800 to eliminate the fraction:

504 = 420M

M = 420/504

M = 800/420

M = 2

C) 4 m
D) 4.2 m
E) 4.4 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* The height of the room is 2 times the semi-perimeter
* The semi-perimeter is 50 cm (given)
* The width of the paper is 50 cm (given)
* The area of the room is 15 sq m (given)
* The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260 (given)

We can start by finding the length of the room. Since the height is 2 times the semi-perimeter, we can write:

Height = 2 x Semi-perimeter

Substituting the given values, we get:

Height = 2 x 50

Height = 100 cm

Now, we can find the width of the room. Since the width is 50 cm (given), and the area of the room is 15 sq m, we can write:

Width = Area / Height

Substituting the given values, we get:

Width = 15 / 100

Width = 0.15 m

Now, we can find the length of the room. Since the width is 0.15 m, and the length is 2 times the width, we can write:

Length = 2 x Width

Substituting the given values, we get:

Length = 2 x 0.15

Length = 0.3 m

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. This means that the first integer is -50, and the next k integers are consecutive.

So, we can write the sum of the first k consecutive integers as:

-50 + (k-1) + k

Since the sum is 51, we can set up the equation:

-50 + (k-1) + k = 51

Simplifying the equation, we get:

k = 51 - 50 + 1

k = 1

So, the answer is A) 40. The first k consecutive integers are -50, -49, -48, ..., -1, 0, 1, 2, ..., 40.",E

D) 40 / 7
E) 50 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start with the given information:

* The mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay.
* We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand.

First, we need to find the amount of sand in the mixture. We can do this by multiplying the total weight of the mixture by the percentage of sand:

30% sand = 30/100 = 0.3 x 10 kg = 3 kg

Now, we know that the mixture contains 3 kg of sand.

Next, we need to find the amount of clay in the mixture. We can do this by subtracting the amount of sand from the total weight of the mixture:

70% clay = 70/100 = 0.7 x 10 kg = 7 kg

Now, we know that the mixture contains 7 kg of clay.

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove the same amount of clay and sand from the mixture. Since there is 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay, we can see that we need to remove 3 kg of clay and 3 kg of sand.

So, to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove 3 kg of clay and 3 kg of sand and replace them with pure sand.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

First, we know that we have a total of 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips.

Since no flowers are to be left out, we need to use all 126 tulips to make the bouquets.

We can start by making bouquets using only white tulips. We can make 28/2 = 14 bouquets of white tulips, since each bouquet needs 28 tulips.

Now, we have 98 - 14 = 84 red tulips left. We can make bouquets using only red tulips as well. We can make 84/2 = 42 bouquets of red tulips, since each bouquet needs 84 tulips.

Since we have used all 126 tulips, we have made a total of 14 + 42 = 56 bouquets.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B) y^2 > x^2.

Here's the reasoning:

Given that x < 0, y > 0, and |x^3| > |y^2|, we can start by noticing that x^3 is negative, while y^2 is positive.

Since |x^3| > |y^2|, it means that the absolute value of x^3 is greater than the absolute value of y^2.

Now, we can compare the absolute values of x^3 and y^2:

|x^3| > |y^2|

This implies that x^3 > y^2, or in other words, x^3 is greater than y^2.

Since x is negative, we know that x^2 is negative as well. Therefore, y^2 must be greater than x^2.

C) 10 Trousers
D) 7 Trousers
E) 11 Trousers
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say the man spends Rs 810 on trouser and shirts.

Since each trouser costs Rs 70, the number of trouser he can buy with Rs 810 is:

810 / 70 = 11

So, the man can buy 11 trouser.

Now, let's find out how many shirts he can buy with the remaining amount:

810 - 700 (cost of 11 trouser) = 110

Since each shirt costs Rs 30, the number of shirts he can buy with Rs 110 is:

110 / 30 = 3

So, the man can buy 3 shirts.

Now, let's find the ratio of trouser to shirts:

Number of trouser : Number of shirts = 11 : 3

Ratio of trouser to shirts = 11/3

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and that it represents a saving of 25% of the cover price.

First, let's find out what the cover price per issue would be if there were no discount. We can do this by dividing the cost of the subscription by the number of issues:

$42.00 ÷ 15 issues = $2.80 per issue (if there were no discount)

Now, we know that the cover price per issue is 25% less than the price without a discount, so we can calculate the cover price per issue as follows:

$2.80 x 0.75 = $2.05 per issue (cover price with a 25% discount)

C) 12.5 %
D) 16.7 %
E) 25 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem:

1. The cost of new tires is $180 per tire.
2. The cost of repairing current tires is $40 per tire.
3. The new tires last for 4 years, so the cost per year is $180 / 4 = $45 per year.
4. The repaired tires last for 1 additional year, so the cost per year is $40 / 1 = $40 per year.

Now, we can calculate the percentage difference between the two options:

The answer is C) 12.5%.

To find the percentage difference, we can divide the difference in cost between the two options by the cost of the cheaper option, and then multiply by 100:

(($180 - $40) / $40) x 100 = (140 / 40) x 100 = 125%

C) $ 216
D) $ 202
E) $ 200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. This means that the interest rate is 6% per six months, or half of the annual rate.

Since the bond has a face value of $5,000, the amount of interest that accrues over the course of the year can be calculated as follows:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is $5,000, the rate is 6% (which is half of the annual rate of 12%), and the time is one year (or 2 six-month periods).

So, the interest that accrues over the course of the year is:

Interest = $5,000 x 6% x 2 = $2,400

Therefore, the total amount that Jerry will receive at maturity is the face value of the bond ($5,000) plus the interest that accrued over the course of the year ($2,400), for a total of:

Total = $5,000 + $2,400 = $7,400

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say Sachin's age 10 years back was x. Then, Sachin's current age is x + 10.

We know that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back, so Ajay's age 10 years back was half of Sachin's age, which is x/2.

Now, we know that Ajay's current age is x/2 + 10.

We are given that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so Sachin's future age will be 40 + 10 = 50.

So, we can set up the equation:

x/2 + 10 = 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x/2 = 40

x = 80

So, Ajay's current age is:

x/2 + 10 = 80/2 + 10 = 40

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 340 meters.

The width of the plot is not given, so we'll assume it's 1 meter (since the question asks about a 1-meter-wide boundary).

The area of the plot is given by the product of the width and length, which we'll assume is 340 meters (since the perimeter is given as 340 meters).

So, the area of the plot is:

Area = width x length = 1 x 340 = 340 square meters

Now, we need to find the cost of gardening the 1-meter-wide boundary around the plot at a rate of $10 per square meter.

The cost of gardening the boundary will be:

Cost = area x rate = 340 x 10 = 3400

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels.
* The remaining revenue (100% - 34%) was from the sale of biographies.
* The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately $x.
* The company's revenue from the sale of biographies was approximately $y.

We can start by finding the value of $x:

$x = 34% of $100 (total revenue)
$x = 0.34 x $100
$x = $34

Now, we can find the value of $y:

$y = (100 - 34) x $34
$y = $66 x $34
$y = $2,244

Now, we can find the ratio of the company's revenue from novels to its revenue from biographies:

$x : $y = 1 : 6.5

Answer Choices:
A) 2000
B) 4000
C) 8000
D) 16000
E) 32000
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

So, the bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by, which means it skips 0.05/100 = 1/200 of the flowers.

If the bee flies by 8 flowers, it will skip 8/200 = 1/25 of the flowers.

So, to bypass 8 flowers, the bee will fly by 25/200 = 1/4 of the total number of flowers.

Now, we can find the total number of flowers the bee will fly by by multiplying the number of flowers it will bypass by the number of times it will bypass them:

1/4 x 8 = 2

So, the bee will fly by 2 x 200 = 400 flowers.

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through each question.

a. 2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2 ( ? ) = ( a - b ) 2

We can start by simplifying the numerator and denominator of the fraction inside the parentheses.

2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2
= 2 - ( b 2 ) / ( a + b ) 2
= 2 - ( b 2 ) / ( a + b ) ( a + b )

Now we can see that the numerator and denominator are both expressions in a + b, so we can cancel out the a + b terms.

2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2
= 2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) ( a + b )
= 2 - b 2 / ( a + b )^2

Now we can see that the expression inside the parentheses is a perfect square, so we can take the square root to isolate the b term.

2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2
= 2 - b 2 / ( a + b )^2
= 2 - b^2 / ( a + b )^2

Now we can see that the expression inside the parentheses is a constant, so we can pull it out of the fraction.

2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2
= 2 - b^2 / ( a + b )^2
= ( 2 - b^2 ) / ( a + b )^2

Now we can see that the numerator and denominator are both constants, so we can simplify the fraction.

2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2
= ( 2 - b^2 ) / ( a + b )^2
= ( 2 - b^2 ) / a + b

Now we can simplify the fraction by combining like terms.

2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2
= ( 2 - b^2 ) / a + b
= ( 2 - b^2 ) / ( a + b )

Now we can see that the expression inside the parentheses is a constant, so we can pull it out of the fraction.

3. To find the time it takes to travel the distance of the tunnel, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

In this case, the distance is 1 mile, and the speed is 120 miles per hour, so:

time = 1 mile / 120 miles/hour = 0.008333 hours (or 8.33 seconds)

Therefore, the train will take 8.33 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel.

Answer Choices:

C) 227.67
D) 215.67
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The invoice for the motor boat has terms of 4/30, n/100, which means that the merchant has 4 months to pay the invoice and will be charged an interest rate of n/100 if they don't pay within that time.

To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to find the highest interest rate that will still allow them to pay off the invoice within the 4-month time frame.

We can do this by setting up an equation based on the formula for simple interest:

SI = P x R x T

where SI is the simple interest, P is the principal (the amount borrowed), R is the interest rate, and T is the time.

Since the merchant is borrowing $20,000, the principal (P) is $20,000. The time (T) is 4 months, or 0.25 years (since there are 12 months in a year).

We need to find the highest interest rate (R) that will allow the merchant to pay off the invoice within 4 months. To do this, we can set up an equation:

20,000 x R x 0.25 = 20,000

Solving for R, we get:

R = 247.67

So, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 247.67%.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's think step by step to find the number of ways to create two groups of 5 members each from 10 lime soda bottles.

Step 1: Choose the first group of 5 members.

There are 10 bottles, and we need to choose 5 of them. We can do this in C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! \* 5!) = 10! / (5! \* 5!) = 105 ways.

Step 2: Choose the second group of 5 members.

Since we have already chosen 5 bottles for the first group, there are now 10 - 5 = 5 bottles left for the second group. We can choose these 5 bottles in C(10, 5) = 10! / (5! \* 5!) = 105 ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways to create two groups of 5 members each from 10 lime soda bottles is:

C) 7
D) 6
E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let's say the amount of wheat is 2x pounds and the amount of corn is 3x pounds. We know that the total weight of the mixture is 3 pounds, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 3x = 3

Simplifying the equation, we get:

5x = 3

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 3/5

Now, we know that the amount of wheat is 2x pounds = 2(3/5) pounds = 6/5 pounds.

Similarly, the amount of corn is 3x pounds = 3(3/5) pounds = 9/5 pounds.

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 7.

Therefore, a bag of the mixture containing 3 pounds of rice would contain 7 pounds of corn.",B

D) Rs . 8
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. First, we know that the company produces 7200 pens, and each pen is priced at Rs. 10.
2. We also know that 10% of the produced pens are defective, so we need to subtract the defective pens from the total number of pens produced.
3. Since the company promises to deliver 7200 pens, we can subtract 10% of 7200, which is 720 (10% of 7200) to get the number of non-defective pens.
4. So, the number of non-defective pens is 7200 - 720 = 6480.
5. We know that the overall profit on all the manufactured pens is 25%, so the profit on the non-defective pens is 25% of 6480, which is 1620.
6. Now, we can find the manufactured cost of each pen by dividing the profit by the number of non-defective pens.

The answer is:

A) 12
B) 24
C) 42
D) 48
E) 49
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The number is a two-digit number, so it has 2 digits.
2. The sum of the digits of the number is greater than the number itself by 18.
3. The digit in the ten's place is double the digit in the unit's place.

Now, let's think about what these constraints imply. Since the sum of the digits is greater than the number itself by 18, we know that the digit in the ten's place must be at least 18. Also, since the digit in the unit's place is double the digit in the ten's place, the digit in the unit's place must be at least half of 18, which is 9.

So, the number must be of the form 10x + 9, where x is the digit in the ten's place.

Now, we can substitute the value of x into the equation 10x + 9 to find the number.

10x + 9 = 10(x) + 9

Simplifying, we get:

10x + 9 = 10x + 9

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4

So, the number is 42.

So, we have two expressions, L(x,y) and R(x,y), and we want to find the relationship between them.

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y]

R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

First, let's look at the individual terms in each expression.

[x] + [y] + [x+y] = x + y + x+y = 2x + 2y

[2x] + [2y] = 2(x) + 2(y) = 2x + 2y

So, we can see that L(x,y) = R(x,y).

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze the given information:

1. The first bell rings after 36 seconds.
2. The second bell rings after 40 seconds.
3. The third bell rings after 48 seconds.

We can observe that the difference between the ringing times of consecutive bells is:

36 - 40 = 4
40 - 48 = 8

So, the pattern of the ringing times is:

36, 40, 48, 56, 64, ...

where each number is 4 more than the previous one.

Now, we need to find when all three bells will ring together again. We can see that the last ringing time is 64 seconds, so the next time all three bells will ring together is when the first bell rings again, which is:

64 + 36 = 100

D) 23
E) 24
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given:

* The electric pole is 14 meters high.
* The shadow of the electric pole is 10 meters long.

We can start by drawing a diagram of the situation:

[Insert diagram of electric pole and shadow]

Since the shadow of the electric pole is 10 meters long, we can assume that the height of the electric pole is equal to the length of the shadow. So, the height of the electric pole is 10 meters.

Now, we need to find the height of the tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions. We can do this by using the same ratio of shadow length to height as the electric pole.

So, we can set up a proportion:

10 (electric pole height) = 15 (tree height)

Now, we can solve for the tree height by cross-multiplying and simplifying:

10 x (15/10) = 15 x (10/10)

This simplifies to:

150 = 15 x 10

Now, we can divide both sides by 15 to solve for the tree height:

150/15 = 10/15

This simplifies to:

10 = 2

So, the height of the tree is 2 times the height of the electric pole, which is 2 x 10 = 20 meters.

A) ( ay − by) / 2

C) ( by − ay) / 2
D) ( ay + by) / x
E) ( a − b) / 2 y
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given information:

We know that the vertices of the triangle are (a, 0), (b, 0), and (x, y). Since a > x > b > 0 > y, we can conclude that:

* a > x > b > 0 > y
* a and b are both positive
* x is greater than both a and b
* y is positive

Now, let's find the area of the triangle. We can use the formula for the area of a triangle:

Area = (base × height) / 2

Since the base of the triangle is (b - a), we can write:

Area = (b - a) × height / 2

Now, we need to find the height of the triangle. We can use the fact that the height is perpendicular to the base, so we can find the height by drawing a line from the vertex (a, 0) to the vertex (x, y). This line has a slope of y/x, so the height is:

height = y/x

Now we can substitute the values we know:

Area = (b - a) × (y/x) / 2

Simplifying, we get:

Area = (b - a) × y / 2x

Now we can substitute the values we know:

Area = (b - a) × y / 2x

Since b > a, we can simplify:

Area = (b - a) × y / 2x

Area = (b - a) × (y/x) / 2

Now we can simplify further:

Area = (b - a) × (y/x) / 2

Area = (b - a) × (y/x) / 2

E) 80 kmph
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the distance traveled by the car is x km.

We know that the car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr, so the time taken to cover the distance is:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = x / 60

We also know that the car travels the same distance in 10 hours, so we can set up an equation:

x / 60 = 10

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 600

So, the distance traveled by the car is 600 km.

Now, we can find out the speed at which the car needs to travel to cover the distance in 10 hours:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 600 / 10

Speed = 60 km/hr

So, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have three friends, Alan, Roger, and Peter, who are attempting to answer a question on an exam. Alan randomly guesses the answer, giving him a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, giving him a 2/3 probability of answering correctly. And Peter dutifully performs the calculations and marks the answer, giving him a 5/6 probability of a correct answer.

We want to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. In other words, we want to find the probability that only Peter answers correctly.

Let's use a tree diagram to represent the situation:

|  |
|---|
| Alan |
|   |
|---|
| Roger |
|   |
|---|
| Peter |

The root of the tree is the question, and the leaves are the three friends. Each node represents a possible outcome of the exam.

Now, let's calculate the probability of each outcome:

1. Alan guesses correctly:

Probability = 1/5

2. Roger cheats and answers correctly:

Probability = 2/3

3. Peter answers correctly without cheating:

Probability = 5/6

Now, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to find the probability that only Peter answers correctly.

To do this, we can use the concept of conditional probability. The probability that the question is answered correctly, given that Peter answers correctly, is 1 (since Peter always answers correctly).

So, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:

Probability = (1/6) \* (1) = 1/6

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is A) 1/6.",A

C) 6 %
D) 8 %
E) 4 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The difference between simple interest and compound interest at the same rate for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72.

Simple interest is calculated as:

Simple interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is Rs. 5000, the time is 2 years, and the rate is the unknown variable we need to find.

So, we can set up the equation:

Simple interest = 5000 x Rate x 2

Now, we know that the difference between simple interest and compound interest is Rs. 72. So, we can set up the equation for compound interest:

Compound interest = 5000 x (1 + Rate/100)^2

We know that the compound interest is Rs. 72 more than the simple interest, so we can subtract the simple interest from the compound interest:

Compound interest - Simple interest = 72

Now we can substitute the values we know:

5000 x (1 + Rate/100)^2 - 5000 x Rate x 2 = 72

Simplifying and solving for the rate, we get:

(1 + Rate/100)^2 - 2 = 72

Rate = 8%

So, the answer is D) 8%.",B

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm . If 50 % of the files were not infected by a virus , how many of Sam ' s files were NOT infected by a worm ?
Answer Choices:
A) 50
B) 70
C) 75
D) 100
E) 125
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.
* The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
* 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.

From the first point, we know that the total number of infected files is 250.

From the second point, we know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So, we can set up a ratio:

Number of files infected only by a worm = 2.5 x Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm

Now, we know that the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is 50% of the total number of files, so we can substitute that in:

Number of files infected only by a worm = 2.5 x 0.5 x 250

Simplifying, we get:

Number of files infected only by a worm = 2.5 x 125

Number of files infected only by a worm = 312.5

Now, we know that the total number of files that were not infected by a virus is:

Total number of files not infected by a virus = Total number of files - Number of files infected only by a worm

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

Total number of files not infected by a virus = 250 - 312.5

Total number of files not infected by a virus = 127.5

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 125.

Note that this answer is the number of files that were not infected by a worm, not the number of files that were not infected by either a virus or a worm. To find the latter, we need to add the number of files not infected by a virus to the number of files not infected by a worm:

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say Mohan's share is x. Then Sohan's share is 5100 - x.

We know that if they invest their shares at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they will receive equal amounts when they turn 26.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + (5100 - x) = 5100 x 1.04^26

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 5100 = 5100 x 1.04^26

Now, we can solve for x:

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, we know that the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. This means that the rate of the liquid flowing through the drain is w gallons per 25 seconds.

Next, we know that we want to find out how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain. To do this, we need to convert the rate of the liquid flowing through the drain from gallons per seconds to gallons per minutes.

There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so we can convert the rate of the liquid flowing through the drain from gallons per seconds to gallons per minutes by multiplying by 60:

w gallons/25 seconds x 60 seconds/minute = 2400 gallons/minute

Now we know that the rate of the liquid flowing through the drain is 2400 gallons per minute. To find out how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we can divide the number of gallons by the rate of the liquid flowing through the drain:

y gallons / 2400 gallons/minute = minutes

So, the answer is:

The answer is A) y / (1200 x y)

In this answer, we have converted the rate of the liquid flowing through the drain from gallons per seconds to gallons per minutes, and then used that rate to find out how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain.",C

Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver, and its weight is 30 grams.
2. The diameter of the coin is 15 mm, and it is 2 mm thick.
3. The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy.
4. Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum.

Now, let's find the volume of the coin:

The volume of a cylinder (coin) is given by:

V = πr^2h

where r is the radius of the coin and h is its thickness.

In this case, the radius of the coin is half of its diameter, so:

r = 15/2 = 7.5 mm

Now, we can find the volume of the coin:

V = π(7.5)^2 x 2 = 307.5 cubic millimeters

Since the weight of the coin is 30 grams, we know that the volume of the coin is equal to the weight of the coin divided by the density of the material.

Now, we can find the density of the alloy:

The density of aluminum is approximately 2.7 g/cm^3, and the density of silver is approximately 10.5 g/cm^3. Since the volume of the alloy is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy, we can assume that the density of the alloy is the average of the densities of aluminum and silver:

density of alloy = (2.7 g/cm^3 + 10.5 g/cm^3) / 2 = 6.65 g/cm^3

Now, we can find the weight of the coin:

weight of coin = volume of coin x density of alloy = 307.5 x 6.65 = 2045.5 grams

Now, we are asked to find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with a diameter of 1 x 30 mm. Since the weight of the coin is proportional to the volume of the coin, we can use the",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* 2/3 of a number is equal to 40
* Subtracting 10 from 2/3 of a number gives us the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number

Let's start by finding 2/3 of a number. We can do this by multiplying the number by 2/3:

2/3 x number = 40

Now, we can solve for the number:

number = 40 x 3/2

number = 60

Now, we can find 1/3 of the number:

1/3 x 60 = 20

So, the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number is:

40 + 20 = 60

Answer Choices:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: The quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 can be factored as (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0. Therefore, we need to find the largest integer value of k for which both (x - 3) and (x - 2) are simultaneously zero.

Let's first find the roots of the equation when k = 0. We have x^2 - 5x + 0 = 0, which factors as (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0. So, the two roots are x = 2 and x = 3.

Now, let's find the largest integer value of k for which the equation still has two distinct roots. As we can see, when k = 1, the equation becomes x^2 - 5x + 1 = 0, and the roots are x = 2 and x = 3. Therefore, the largest integer value of k for which the equation has two distinct roots is k = 1.

Since the dog eats at 8:00 am, 9:00 am, 10:00 am, and so on, there are 4 feeding sessions in total. So, the amount of dog food left in the bowl at noon (12:00 pm) is:

x - (1/3)x - (1/3)x + (1/3)x = 2/3x - (2/3)x = x/3

Now, we want to find out what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon. To do this, we can divide the amount of food left in the bowl at noon by the initial amount of food:

x/3 / x = 1/3

D) 200
E) 80
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given in the problem:

* 60% of the people who took the survey were women.
* Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.

We can start by finding out how many women took the survey. Since 60% of the survey takers were women, we can find the number of women by multiplying the total number of survey takers by 60/100:

Total number of survey takers x 60/100 = Number of women

We know that 10 men liked green cars more than red cars, so we can find the total number of men by subtracting the number of men who preferred red cars from the total number of survey takers:

Total number of survey takers - Number of men who preferred red cars = Number of men

Now we can substitute the values we have found to find the total number of survey takers:

Total number of survey takers = Number of women + Number of men

Substituting the values, we get:

Total number of survey takers = (Total number of survey takers x 60/100) + (Total number of survey takers - Number of men who preferred red cars)

Simplifying, we get:

Total number of survey takers = (Total number of survey takers x 60/100) + (Total number of survey takers - Number of men who preferred red cars)

Solving for the total number of survey takers, we get:

Total number of survey takers = (Total number of survey takers x 60/100) + (Total number of survey takers - Number of men who preferred red cars)

The answer is:

The answer is C) 50.

Explanation:

We know that 60% of the survey takers were women, so the number of women is 60% of the total number of survey takers. We also know that 10 men preferred green cars over red cars, so the number of men who preferred red cars is 75% of the total number of men (10/100 x 75/100 = 7.5). Therefore, the total",A

C) 1.25
D) 1.5
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we know that one gallon of soft drink is made up of 40% orange juice and 60% water. This means that 40% of one gallon is orange juice, and 60% is water.

If we want to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add more orange juice to the mixture. To find out how much more, we can set up a proportion:

Let x be the number of gallons of orange juice we need to add.

We know that 40% of one gallon is orange juice, so 40% of x gallons is also orange juice.

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink, so we need to add enough orange juice to make up 60% of the total volume of the soft drink.

So, we can set up the following proportion:

40% of x = 60% of (1 gallon + x)

Now we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the proportion by 100 to eliminate the percentages:

40x = 60(1 + x)

Now we can simplify the equation:

40x = 60 + 60x

Solving for x, we get:

40x = 120

x = 3

So, we need to add 3 gallons of orange juice to the mixture to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

The answer is C) 1.25 gallons of orange juice.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. We are given that 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N, and the remainders are the same.
2. This means that N must be a multiple of 2272 and 875, so we can write N = 2272k + 875l, where k and l are integers.
3. Since the sum of the digits of N is 10 (2+2+7+2+5), we know that k + l = 10.
4. Now, we can substitute the values of 2272 and 875 into the equation N = 2272k + 875l:

2272k + 875l = 2272(10) + 875(10)

Simplifying, we get:

2272k + 875l = 22720 + 8750

25470 = 2272k + 875l

Now, we can solve for k + l:

Answer Choices:
A) 44 %
B) 66 %
C) 68 %
D) 72 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say there are x passing students and y failing students in the class. We know that the passing students have an average of 83, so the total score of the passing students is 83x. The failing students have an average of 55, so the total score of the failing students is 55y.

We also know that the overall class average is 76, so we can set up the following equation:

83x + 55y = 76

Now, we can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

83x + 55y = 83x + 55(y-x)

Since the passing students have an average of 83, we know that x is equal to the number of passing students. And since the failing students have an average of 55, we know that y is equal to the number of failing students.

So, we can substitute x and y into the equation:

83x + 55y = 83(x) + 55(y-x)

Now, we can simplify the equation further:

83x + 55y = 83x + 55(number of failing students)

We know that the number of failing students is y-x, so we can substitute that in:

83x + 55(y-x) = 83x + 55(number of failing students)

Now we can solve for the percentage of students who passed:

83x + 55(y-x) = 83x + 55(number of failing students)

We know that the total number of students in the class is x + y, so we can substitute that in:

83x + 55(y-x) = 83x + 55(number of failing students)

Now we can simplify the equation further:

83x + 55(y-x) = 83x + 55(x + y - x)

We know that x + y - x is equal to the number of failing students, so we can substitute that in:

C) $ 90
D) $ 97
E) $ 104
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The worker earned $90 per day on average during the fortnight.
2. During the first 7 days, the worker earned $87 per day on average.
3. During the last 7 days, the worker earned $92 per day on average.

Now, let's find the average wage for the entire fortnight:

Average wage for the fortnight = (87 x 7) + (92 x 7) / 15
= (87 x 7) + (92 x 7) / 15
= 601 + 644 / 15
= 601 + 42.93
= 643.93

So, the worker's average wage for the fortnight was $643.93.

Now, we need to find the worker's wage on the 8th day. To do this, we can use the fact that the worker's average wage for the fortnight was $643.93.

Wage on the 8th day = Average wage for the fortnight x (8/15)
= 643.93 x 8/15
= 643.93 x 0.8
= 519.14

So, the worker's wage on the 8th day was $519.14.

So, we know that the two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, and if 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.

Let's call the smaller number x. Then, the larger number is 3x + 9.

So, we can set up the equation:

3x + 9 = 12

Now, we can subtract 9 from both sides:

3x = 12 - 9

3x = 3

Now, we can divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:

x = 3/3

x = 1

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* Ajay's present age is x.
* If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, the remainder is divided by 18, and the result is Rahul's present age.
* Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years.

We can start by subtracting 6 years from Ajay's present age:

x - 6 = ?

Since the remainder is divided by 18, we know that the answer will be an integer.

Now, we can find the present age of Rahul:

Rahul's present age = (x - 6) / 18

Since Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, we know that Rahul's present age is 5 - 2 = 3 years younger than Denis's present age.

So, we can set up the equation:

Rahul's present age = Denis's present age - 3

Now we can substitute the value of Denis's present age:

Rahul's present age = 5 + 3 = 8

Now we can find Ajay's present age:

Ajay's present age = Rahul's present age + 6

Ajay's present age = 8 + 6 = 14

C) 126
D) 252
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by letting the length of the unpainted side be x feet. Since the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 3x = 37

Simplifying the equation, we get:

6x = 37

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

x = 6

So, the length of the unpainted side is 6 feet. The area of the parking space is given by the product of the lengths of all four sides:

Area = x \* (2x + 3x)

= 6 \* (2(6) + 3(6))

= 6 \* (12 + 18)

= 6 \* 30

= 180 square feet

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

Peter has 10 friends who want to participate in the scavenger hunt, and he wants to form a team of 10 people. This means he has to choose 10 people from his list of 10 friends.

To find the number of choices Peter has, we can use the formula for the number of ways to choose k items from a list of n items, which is:

n! / (k! \* (n-k)!)

In this case, n = 10 (the number of friends) and k = 10 (the number of people Peter wants to choose for his team).

So, we can calculate the number of choices as follows:

10! / (10! \* 0!) = 10! / (10 \* 9!) = 10 \* 9 = 90

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 90.

Find the weight of the new man .
Answer Choices:
A) 71
B) 62
C) 43
D) 67
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat before the replacement. We know that the average weight is increased by 1.8 kg when the new man is added, so we can set up the following equation:

Average weight before = (10 x weight of oarsman 1) + (10 x weight of oarsman 2) + ... + (10 x weight of oarsman 10)

Since the average weight is increased by 1.8 kg, we can write:

Average weight after = (10 x weight of oarsman 1) + (10 x weight of oarsman 2) + ... + (10 x weight of oarsman 10) + 1.8

Now, we know that the weight of the new man is 53 kg, so we can substitute this value into the equation for the average weight after:

Average weight after = (10 x weight of oarsman 1) + (10 x weight of oarsman 2) + ... + (10 x weight of oarsman 10) + 53

We are also given that the average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat before the replacement is increased by 1.8 kg, so we can subtract the weight of the new man from the average weight after to find the weight of the new man:

Weight of new man = Average weight after - Weight of oarsman 1
= (10 x weight of oarsman 1) + (10 x weight of oarsman 2) + ... + (10 x weight of oarsman 10) + 53 - 53
= 10 x weight of oarsman 1 + 10 x weight of oarsman 2 + ... + 10 x weight of oarsman 10

Since the average weight before is increased by 1.8 kg, we know that the weight of the new man must be at least 1.8 kg greater than the weight of the oarsman who is being replaced. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:

Weight of new man > Weight of",A

B) 10
C) 9
D) 8
E) 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

There are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box without selecting the ball with number 3 marked on it.

To count the number of ways to select two balls, we can use the multiplication principle, which states that the number of ways to select k objects from n objects is n^k.

In this case, we want to select two balls, so k = 2. We also know that one of the balls must not be the ball with number 3 marked on it, so we need to subtract the number of ways to select two balls that include the ball with number 3.

Let's count the number of ways to select two balls that include the ball with number 3:

There is one way to select the ball with number 3, and then there are n - 1 ways to select the second ball (since we can't select the ball with number 3). So, the number of ways to select two balls that include the ball with number 3 is:

1 x (n - 1) = n - 1

Now, we can subtract the number of ways to select two balls that include the ball with number 3 from the total number of ways to select two balls:

45 - (n - 1) = 45 - n + 1

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2n - 45 = 0

Solving for n, we get:

n = 10

So, the answer is C) 10.",A

I. Q is the square of a prime number.

If Q is the square of a prime number, then it can be written as $Q = p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that $p^2$ must have at least 5 factors. However, the only factors of $p^2$ are $1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4$, so it is not possible for $p^2$ to have 5 factors. Therefore, this option is false.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.

If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, then it can be written as $Q = p^4$, where $p$ is a prime number. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that $p^4$ must have at least 5 factors. However, the only factors of $p^4$ are $1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4$, so it is not possible for $p^4$ to have 5 factors. Therefore, this option is false.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 per hour.
2. He finishes two-thirds of the work, so he spends 2/3 of 12 hours cleaning, which is 2/3 x 12 = 8 hours.
3. Jill finishes the remaining work, which is 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the total work.
4. Since Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, Jill's rate is 5/100 x 1/12 = 1/240 per hour.
5. So, Jill spends 1/3 x 1/240 = 1/84 hours to finish the remaining work.

A) 2 %
B) 8 %
C) 5 %
D) 10 %
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, we know that the professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. This means that the interest rate is a fixed percentage of the principal amount, and the interest is paid only on the principal amount and not on the interest earned in previous periods.

Next, we know that after 3 years, the university received Rs. 300 on interest. This means that the total amount received by the university was Rs. 5000 (principal) + Rs. 300 (interest), which is a total of Rs. 5300.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Principal = Rs. 5000
Interest = Rs. 300
Total = Rs. 5300

We can solve for the interest rate using the formula for simple interest:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the time is 3 years, and the interest rate is the unknown variable we're trying to find. So, we can set up the equation:

300 = 5000 x R x 3

Now, we can solve for R (the interest rate) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5000:

R = 300 / 5000

R = 0.06

Therefore, the answer is C) 5%. The interest rate was 5% per annum.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

We know that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents.

We can start by converting the cost from cents to dollars by dividing by 100:

27 bottles x A cents / 100 = 2700 / A

Now we can see that the cost of 27 bottles is 2700 / A.

To find the cost of B bottles, we can simply multiply the cost of 27 bottles by the number of bottles we want to find the cost for:

2700 / A x B = 2700 / A x (27 x B)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

2700 / A x (27 x B) = 2700 / A x 27B

Now we can see that the cost of B bottles is 2700 / A x 27B.

The answer is:

The answer is B x 2700 / A.

So, the cost of B bottles is 2700 / A x 27B.",A

Answer Choices:
A) 8
B) 28
C) 46
D) 66
E) 70
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's first consider the cost of 3 candy bars. We have 3 candy bars that cost $50 each, so the total cost of these bars is $50 x 3 = $150.

Now, we have 4 candy bars that cost $1 each, so the total cost of these bars is $1 x 4 = $4.

Finally, we have 4 candy bars that cost $2 each, so the total cost of these bars is $2 x 4 = $8.

Total cost = $150 + $4 + $8 = $162.

Now, we need to find out how many ways we can select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4.

To do this, we can use the concept of combinations. We can choose 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars in C(11, 3) = 11! / (3! x 8!) ways.

However, not all of these combinations will result in a total cost of more than $4. We need to exclude the combinations that include any of the $1 or $2 candy bars, as their total cost is less than $4.

So, we need to subtract out the number of ways we can select 3 candy bars from the $1 and $2 candy bars. We can do this using the formula for combinations with no repeats: C(11 - 3, 3) = (11 - 3) x (10 - 3) x (9 - 3) / (3! x 8! x 7!).

Simplifying this expression, we get:

C(11, 3) - C(3, 3) = 11! / (3! x 8!) - 3! x 2! x 7!

= 11 x 9 x 8 / (3 x 2 x 7)

= 840 / 12

= 70

So, there are 70 ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars so that the total",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

There are 4 men and 4 women in the team, so there are a total of 4 x 4 = 16 possible pairs of presenters.

However, we cannot have a team of only men or only women, so we need to subtract the number of pairs that can be formed with only men or only women.

There are 3 ways to choose 2 men from the team of 4 men (3 x 2 = 6), and there are 3 ways to choose 2 women from the team of 4 women (3 x 2 = 6).

So, the total number of pairs of presenters that can be formed is:

16 - 6 - 6 = 16 - 12 = 4

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 180.

There are 180 different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team of 4 men and 4 women, since each presenter can be chosen in 4 different ways (4 x 4 = 16), and each of these pairs can be combined with any of the remaining 3 presenters in 3 different ways (3 x 3 = 9), for a total of 180 different groups of presenters.",B

C) 4 / 7
D) 2 / 5
E) 2 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

To be relatively prime to 1,000, a number must not have any common positive factors with 1,000 other than 1. In other words, it must be a prime number or a number with only 1 as a factor.

There are 1,000 numbers in the set S, and we know that 1 is a common factor for all of them. So, we can subtract 1 from each number in S to find the numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000.

The numbers in S are: 1, 2, 3, ..., 1000.

Subtracting 1 from each number gives us:

1 - 1 = 0, 2 - 1 = 1, 3 - 1 = 2, ..., 1000 - 1 = 999.

Now, we have a list of 1000 numbers that are relatively prime to 1,000.

The probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is therefore the number of relatively prime numbers in S divided by the total number of numbers in S, which is:

1000 / 1000 = 1

We know that Charles received $54,080 at the end of his one-year investment, including interest and principal. We also know that the investment paid an annual interest of 8% compounded semi-annually.

First, let's calculate the interest earned on the investment. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, we need to calculate the interest for each six-month period.

For the first six months, the interest is:

8% of $45,000 (principal) = $3,600

For the second six months, the interest is:

8% of $45,000 (principal) = $3,600

Total interest earned = $3,600 + $3,600 = $7,200

Now, we add the interest earned to the principal to find the total amount that Charles originally invested:

Total amount = $45,000 (principal) + $7,200 (interest) = $52,200

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given information:

1. Joe's age, his sister's age, and their father's age sum up to 100.
2. When Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now.
3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father.

Let's start by assuming that Joe's age is x. Then, his sister's age is 2x, and their father's age is 3x.

1. The sum of their ages is 100:

x + 2x + 3x = 100

Simplify the equation:

3x + 2x = 100

5x = 100

x = 20

So, Joe's age is 20.

2. When Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now:

20 + 2(20) = 20 + 40 = 60

So, Joe's sister will be 60 years old when Joe is 20.

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father:

3(20) = 60

So, Joe's father will be 60 - 20 = 40 years old when Joe's sister was 20 years old.

x = m/100 \* 4y

m/100 is a fraction, so we can multiply both the numerator and denominator by 100 to get:

x = 100m/100 \* 4y

= 4y

Therefore, x is 50 times y.",D

Answer Choices:
A) 58
B) 62
C) 66
D) 70
E) 74
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by identifying the dimensions of the yard. Since the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we know that the length of the yard must be 240 / width. Since we are leaving one side unfenced, we can let the width be 10 meters, so the length of the yard is 240 / 10 = 24 meters.

Now, we need to find the perimeter of the yard, which is the distance around the yard. Since we are fencing three sides, we need to add the lengths of the three fenced sides. The perimeter of the yard is 24 + 24 + 24 = 72 meters.

Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, we don't need to fence that side, so we only need to fence two sides. Therefore, the amount of fencing Alice needs is 72 - 10 = 62 meters.

Answer Choices:
A) $ 27.30
B) $ 51.00
C) $ 63.00
D) $ 70.00
E) $ 91.00 [/INST] A: The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above its cost, which means the selling price is 100% (the cost) + 40% (profit) = 140% of the cost. Given that the gross profit is $20, and it represents 40% of the cost, it means 40% of the cost is $20. So, if 40% of the cost is $20, then 100% (the cost) is rac{100}{40} 	imes 20 = $50. Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for the cost plus the profit, which is $50 + $20 = $70. Hence, the answer is D) $70.00.</s><s>[INST] Q: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51 .

B) 32
C) 35
D) 36
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The worker takes 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour.
2. To cycle from home to work, the worker will take the same route and cover the same distance.
3. Since the worker is cycling at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour, it will take longer to cover the same distance as driving.

Now, let's calculate the time it takes to cycle from home to work:

Time = Distance / Speed

In this case, the distance is the same as the driving distance, which is:

Distance = 20 km (driving distance)

The speed of cycling is:

Speed = 6 km/h

Now, we can calculate the time:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 20 km / 6 km/h

Time = 3.33 hours (approximately)

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert the time to minutes:

Time = 3.33 hours x 60 minutes/hour

Time = 200 minutes

Therefore, the worker will take approximately 200 minutes (or 3 hours and 20 minutes) to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.
