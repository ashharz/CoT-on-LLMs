The answer is B.</s><s>[INST] A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?

C) 7 ( √ 3 – 1)
D) 8 ( √ 3 – 2)
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, so the angle of elevation changes by 15°.

We know that the angle of elevation is related to the height of the tower and the distance between the car and the tower.

Let's assume that the distance between the car and the tower is x.

The angle of elevation is given by:

tan(angle) = height / distance

So, we can set up the equation:

tan(45°) = tower height / x

We know that the tower height is 100 meters, so:

tan(45°) = 100 / x

Now, we can find the distance x by solving for it:

x = 100 / tan(45°)

x = 100 / 1.66

x = 60

So, the car will reach the base of the tower in 60 minutes.

D) $ 70
E) $ 78.20
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item.
2. The discounted price of the item was 22% of the original price.
3. The customer used a $20-off coupon.
4. There is no tax on the item.

Now, let's calculate the original price of the item:

1.90 = (1/2) \* original price + 20

Simplifying the equation:

1.90 = (1/2) \* original price + 20

Solving for the original price:

original price = 2 x 1.90 / (1 + 20)

original price = 2 x 1.90 / 21

original price = 2 x 1.90 / 21

original price = 67.40

Answer Choices:
A) 0.22
B) 0.26
C) 0.37
D) 0.46
E) 0.63
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's define two events:

Event A: Stock A increases in value during the next month.
Event B: Stock B increases in value during the next month.

We know that the probability of Event A is 0.56, and the probability of Event B is 0.74.

We want to find the probability that neither Event A nor Event B occurs. This is equivalent to finding the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases in value during the next month.

To do this, we can use the Inclusive OR rule, which states that the probability of at least one of two events occurring is equal to the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring.

So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases in value during the next month is:

P(neither) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

where P(A) is the probability of Stock A increasing in value, P(B) is the probability of Stock B increasing in value, and P(A ∩ B) is the probability of both Stock A and Stock B increasing in value.

We know that P(A) = 0.56, P(B) = 0.74, and P(A ∩ B) = 0.56 x 0.74 = 0.41.

So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases in value during the next month is:

P(neither) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.41

P(neither) = 0.85

The answer is C. The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases in value during the next month is 0.85.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The profit made by the trader is 20% of the cost price of the article, so we can set up the equation:

Profit = 20% of Cost Price

Profit = 0.20 x Cost Price

We know that the profit is Rs. 360, so we can substitute this into the equation:

360 = 0.20 x Cost Price

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 0.20 to solve for the cost price:

Cost Price = 360 / 0.20

Cost Price = 1800

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's use a systematic approach to solve this problem.

Let x be the number of students who attended the prom night.

Since at least 45% of the students attended the prom night, we know that x / 100 = 45.

So, x = 45 x 100 = 4500.

Now, let y be the number of students who took part in the debating session.

Since at least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, we know that y / 100 = 35.

So, y = 35 x 100 = 3500.

Now, we know that the total number of students is 200, so we can set up the equation:

x + y = 200

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

4500 + 3500 = 200

Simplifying, we get:

8000 = 200

This is impossible, since 8000 is not divisible by 200.

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 0.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale.
2. The sales person needs to reach a salary of at least $1000.

We can start by finding out how much the sales person needs to earn in commissions to reach a salary of $1000:

10% of $1000 = $100

So, the sales person needs to earn $100 in commissions.

Now, we can find out how many sales the sales person needs to make to earn $100 in commissions:

$100 / $250 (per sale) = 0.4 (number of sales)

Therefore, the sales person needs to make 4 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

A) 226
B) 230
C) 240
D) 260
E) 280
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we know that the company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, so the total production cost per month is:

420 units x $110 per unit = $46,200 per month

Since the company sells all of the components by the end of each month, the total revenue per month is:

420 units x (selling price per unit) = $46,200 per month

We want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, so we need to find the selling price per unit that will result in a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

Let's calculate the yearly profit:

Yearly profit = 12 x (monthly profit)

Yearly profit = 12 x ($626,400 / 12)

Yearly profit = $51,366.67 per month

Now we can set up an equation to find the selling price per unit:

Selling price per unit = Yearly profit / (420 units x monthly production cost)

Selling price per unit = $51,366.67 / (420 units x $46,200)

Selling price per unit = $230

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

1. 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so 10% of the total number of staplers produced on Monday were defective.
2. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so 2% of the total number of non-defective staplers were rejected.
3. 72 non-defective staplers were rejected.

Now, let's calculate the total number of staplers produced on Monday:

Total number of staplers produced on Monday = (100% - 10% - 2%) x Total number of non-defective staplers

= (90%) x (Total number of non-defective staplers)

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so the total number of non-defective staplers is:

Total number of non-defective staplers = 72 / (100% - 2%)

= 72 / 98

= 73

Now, we can calculate the total number of staplers produced on Monday:

Total number of staplers produced on Monday = (90%) x 73

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: There are 7 letters in the word `PROBLEC`. To make 7 letter words without any repeated letters, we need to choose 7 letters from the 8 letters in the word.

To count the number of valid arrangements, we need to subtract the number of arrangements with repeated letters. There are 21 possible repeated letters (i.e., the letters `P`, `O`, `B`, `L`, `E`, `C` can each be repeated up to 3 times), and each repeated letter can be placed in 3 different positions (i.e., at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of the word).

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that A and B are independent events, so the probability of A given B (P(A|B)) is equal to the probability of B given A (P(B|A)), and both are equal to P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8.

Now, we can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

We can write P(A ∩ B) as:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B|A) = 0.2 x 0.8 = 0.16

So,

P(A|B) = P(B|A) = 0.16

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the first 10 months of the year is 20.
2. The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is the average of 20 and the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the last 12 months.
3. The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the last 12 months is given as 42.
4. To find the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period, we need to weight the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the first 10 months by the number of months they represent (10/22) and the average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the last 12 months by the number of months they represent (12/22).
5. The weighted average is: (20 x 10/22) + (42 x 12/22) = (20 x 0.45) + (42 x 0.55) = 9 + 22 = 31.

The average score for the entire class is y, and the average score of the highest and lowest scores is equal to x. We know that the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is what we're trying to find.

First, let's find the average of the highest and lowest scores:

x = (highest score + lowest score) / 2

Since the highest score is excluded, the lowest score is the score that is immediately below the highest score. So, the lowest score is (highest score - 1).

x = (highest score + (highest score - 1)) / 2

x = (2 highest score + 1) / 2

D) 30
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the grocer sells x bags of flour.

We know that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour. So, the profit per bag is 25% of $100, which is $25.

We also know that the grocer makes a total profit of $3,000. So, the total profit from selling all the bags of flour is:

Profit = $25 x number of bags

We can set up an equation based on this information:

$3,000 = $25 x number of bags

Now, we can solve for the number of bags by dividing both sides of the equation by $25:

Number of bags = $3,000 / $25

Number of bags = 120

So, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

E) 19
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so he makes 35 toys in 7 hours, which means he makes 1 toy in 7/35 = 1/5 hours.
2. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he makes 35 toys in 9 hours, which means he makes 1 toy in 9/35 = 1/4 hours.
3. Since both Alex and Jacob have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that the difference in the number of hours they worked is minimal. Let's assume that Alex worked for 40 hours and Jacob worked for 45 hours (just a random number, but it will give us a solution).
4. Now, we can calculate the total number of toys made by Alex and Jacob:

Alex: 35 toys / 1 toy per 1/5 hours = 35 x 5 = 175 toys
Jacob: 35 toys / 1 toy per 1/4 hours = 35 x 4 = 140 toys

D) 7890
E) 6780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

1/16 of the students study math, so there are 16x/100 = 160 students studying math.

1/10 of the students study bio, so there are 10x/100 = 100 students studying bio.

1/8 of the students study english, so there are 8x/100 = 80 students studying english.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we know that the sum of the number of students studying each subject must be a multiple of 100.

So, we can set up the equation:

160 + 100 + 80 = 1000 (since there are 1000 students in total)

Simplifying the equation:

340 = 1000

Now, we can find the maximum and minimum number of students by filling in the equation with the maximum and minimum values for each subject:

Maximum:

160 + 100 + 80 = 340

Minimum:

160 + 100 + 20 = 380

So, the maximum number of students is 380 and the minimum number of students is 340.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

On a normal day, Bill's average speed is 15 mph, so we can start by calculating his distance traveled in 21 minutes:

15 mph x 21 minutes = 315 miles

Now, on a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so we need to subtract 4 mph from his average speed:

15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

Now, we can calculate the distance Bill can travel in 21 minutes at 11 mph:

11 mph x 21 minutes = 231 miles

E) $ 91.00
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, so we can set up the equation:

Selling price = Cost + (Gross profit x 100%)

2. We know that the gross profit was $20.00, so we can substitute this into the equation:

Selling price = Cost + (20 x 100%)

3. To find the cost, we can solve for it by subtracting the gross profit from both sides of the equation:

Selling price - Gross profit = Cost + Gross profit

4. Now we can substitute the values we know:

C) 36 %
D) 40 %
E) 42 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost, so we can set up the equation:

Retail price = Wholesale cost x 1.6

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so we can set up the equation:

Sale price = Retail price x 0.8

Now we can substitute the equation for the retail price into the equation for the sale price:

Sale price = Wholesale cost x 1.6 x 0.8

Simplifying, we get:

Sale price = Wholesale cost x 1.28

So the appliance was sold for 128% of its wholesale cost. The answer is C. The appliance was sold for 36% more than its wholesale cost.",B

Answer Choices:
A) Rs . 697.50
B) Rs . 712.50
C) Rs . 787.50
D) Rs . 750
E) Rs . 780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5% on the marked price of the watch, so the selling price is:

Marked price x (1 - 5%) = Rs. 750 x (1 - 5%) = Rs. 750 x 0.95 = Rs. 712.50

2. The shopkeeper earns a profit of Rs. 15 less when he gives a discount of 7%. So, the profit he earns at a 7% discount is:

Profit = Marked price - Selling price = Rs. 750 - Rs. 712.50 = Rs. 37.50

3. Since the profit is Rs. 37.50 less, we can set up the equation:

Rs. 750 - Rs. 37.50 = Rs. 712.50

Solving for the marked price, we get:

Rs. 750 = Rs. 712.50 + Rs. 37.50

The answer is:

The marked price of the watch is Rs. 780.

B) 2520
C) 1728
D) 1656
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The student found the value of 7/18 of a number, which means the number is 18 times the value of 7/8 of the number.
2. The student's answer differed from the actual answer by 770.

Now, let's find the actual answer:

7/8 of the number = x

7/18 of the number = 18x

The student's answer = 18x + 770

We want to find the value of x.

So, we can set up the equation:

18x + 770 = actual answer

We know the actual answer is 2520, so:

18x + 770 = 2520

Subtracting 770 from both sides gives us:

18x = 1750

Dividing both sides by 18 gives us:

x = 1750 / 18

x = 97

The answer is C) 1728.

The student's answer was 18x + 770 = 2520, which is 770 more than the actual answer of 2520. Therefore, the answer is C) 1728.",A

Answer Choices:
A) 384
B) 562
C) 458
D) 156
E) 452
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The plane flies along the four sides of a square, so it covers four sides of equal length.
2. The speeds of the plane are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr.
3. To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance covered by the plane and divide it by the time taken.
4. The total distance covered by the plane is the sum of the distances covered on each side of the square.
5. The distance covered on each side is equal to the speed x time, so the total distance covered is:

200 km/hr x 2 sides = 400 km
400 km/hr x 2 sides = 800 km
600 km/hr x 2 sides = 1200 km
800 km/hr x 2 sides = 1600 km

Total distance covered = 400 + 800 + 1200 + 1600 = 4000 km

6. The time taken to cover this distance is equal to the total distance divided by the speed, so:

Time = 4000 km / (200 km/hr + 400 km/hr + 600 km/hr + 800 km/hr)

Time = 4000 km / (200 + 400 + 600 + 800)

Time = 4000 km / 2400 km

Time = 1.67 hours

7. Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance covered by the time taken:

Average speed = Total distance / Time
= 4000 km / 1.67 hours
= 2350 km/hr

The answer is C) 2350 km/hr.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

* Jack buys 18 sharpeners.
* He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners.

We can start by finding the total amount Jack pays for all the sharpeners:

18 x 100 = 1800

Now, we can divide the total amount by the cost of each brown sharpeners:

1800 / 100 = 18

So, Jack buys 18 brown sharpeners.

Now, we can find the cost of the white sharpeners:

1800 - 18 x 100 = 1620

Therefore, Jack buys 11 white sharpeners (1620 / 150 = 11).

The answer is:

D) 50 %
E) 60 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

* 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.
* 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.

We can start by finding out how many students are members of the swim team:

20% of all students are members of the swim team, so the number of students who are members of the swim team is:

20% x (total number of students) = 20% x (100) = 20

Now, we need to subtract the number of students who are not members of the chess club from the total number of students who are members of the swim team:

20 - (20% of members of the swim team who are not members of the chess club) = 20 - (20% x 20) = 20 - 4 = 16

So, there are 16 students who are members of the swim team and not members of the chess club.

Now, we can find out what percentage of all Daifu students are members of the swim team:

(number of students who are members of the swim team) / (total number of students) x 100 = (16) / (100) x 100 = 16%

The answer is C) 16%.",B

C) 85800
D) 90000
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The population of the city increases by 5% annually, which means the population growth rate is 5%.

To find the population after 2 years, we need to calculate the population growth for each year separately and then add them up.

Year 1:
Current population = 78000
Population growth rate = 5%
New population = 78000 x 1.05 = 82800

Year 2:
New population = 82800 x 1.05 = 87240

Total population after 2 years = 82800 + 87240 = 170040

D) 1.75
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the time it takes for the first car to travel 50 miles at 12 mph is x hours. Then, the time it takes for the second car to travel 50 miles at 13 mph is also x hours.

We know that the two cars start at the same time, so the time it takes for the first car to travel 50 miles is the same as the time it takes for the second car to travel 50 miles.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

12x = 13x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1.25

So, the first car will meet the second car 1.25 hours after they begin.

The answer is C. The first car will meet the second car 1.50 hours after they begin.",E

Monthly sale = (1500 x 15%) / 100

E) 12 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The amount borrowed is Rs. 360, and the monthly installments are Rs. 31.50 each. So, the total number of installments is:

360 / 31.50 = 12

Now, we can calculate the total interest paid by the borrower:

Total interest = (360 x 12) / 12
= 360 x 12
= 4320

Now, we can calculate the interest rate:

Interest rate = (4320 / 360) x 100
= (4320 / 360) x 100
= 120%

So, the answer is:

The answer is B. 4.5%

C) 10
D) 11
E) 12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days, so he can complete 1/3 of the contract in 6 days.
2. Mr. Black can paint a house in 8 days, so he can complete 1/3 of the contract in 8 days.
3. Mr. Blue can paint a house in 12 days, so he can complete 1/3 of the contract in 12 days.
4. After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and Mr. Black begins to work for a period of 6 days.
5. Mr. Black can complete 1/3 of the contract in 6 days, so he will complete 1/3 of the remaining part of the contract.
6. Mr. Blue will complete the remaining part of the contract, which is 2/3 of the contract.

Now, let's calculate the total number of days it will take Mr. Blue to complete the contract:

1/3 of the contract = 6 days (by Mr. Brown) + 6 days (by Mr. Black) + 12 days (by Mr. Blue) = 24 days

2/3 of the contract = 12 days (by Mr. Blue)

C) 900
D) 950
E) 1000
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

* 8% of total students are interested in Football, so the number of students interested in Football is 8% of the total number of students.
* 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, so the number of students interested in Cricket is 4/5 of the total number of students.
* 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, so the number of students interested in Basketball is 10% of the total number of students.
* 20 students are not interested in any games, so the total number of students is 20 more than the sum of the number of students interested in Football, Cricket, and Basketball.

Now, let's calculate the number of students interested in each sport:

* Football: 8% of total students = 0.08 \* total students
* Cricket: 4/5 of total students = 0.4 \* total students
* Basketball: 10% of total students = 0.10 \* total students

Now, let's add up the number of students interested in each sport:

0.08 \* total students + 0.4 \* total students + 0.10 \* total students = total students

Now, we can solve for total students:

0.08 \* total students + 0.4 \* total students + 0.10 \* total students = total students

Simplifying the equation:

0.58 \* total students = total students

Now, we can solve for total students:

C) 62 m
D) 63 m
E) 64 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by given information:

A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1 m more than the 4 times the breadth.

Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. Then, the length of the rectangular piece would be 4x + 1 meters.

We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the width is the breadth of the rectangular piece, so we can write:

Perimeter = 2(4x + 1 + x)

Simplifying, we get:

Perimeter = 2(5x + 1)

Now, we know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 sq m, so we can set up the equation:

5x + 1 = 150

Solving for x, we get:

5x = 149

x = 29.8

Now we can find the length of the rectangular piece:

4x + 1 = 4(29.8) + 1

4x + 1 = 119.2 + 1

4x + 1 = 120.2

x = 29.8

The answer is B.</s><s>[INST] One gram of a certain health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A . If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source , how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins ?
Answer Choices:
A) 8.5
B) 10.5
C) 12.5
D) 14.5
E) 16.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's first find out how much of each vitamin is present in one gram of the health food.

9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is:

9% x (daily requirement of vitamin E) = 0.09 x (?)

where ? is the daily requirement of vitamin E.

We know that the daily requirement of vitamin E is 15 mg, so:

0.09 x 15 = 1.35 mg

8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is:

8% x (daily requirement of vitamin A) = 0.08 x (?)

where ? is the daily requirement of vitamin A.

We know that the daily requirement of vitamin A is 900 mcg, so:

0.08 x 900 = 72 mcg

Now, we need to find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

Let's first find out how much of each vitamin is present in one gram of the health food:

Vitamin E: 1.35 mg
Vitamin A: 72 mcg

Now, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the problem:

Let x be the number of grams of the health food consumed daily.

We want to find out how much of each vitamin is present in x grams of the health food.

Let's write the equations:

Vitamin E: 1.35 x = 1.35 mg
Vitamin A: 0.08 x = 72 mcg

Now, we can solve the system of equations.

First, we can solve the equation for vitamin E:

1.35 x = 1.35 mg

x = 1.35 / 1.35 = 1

So, we need to consume 1 gram of the health food daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.

Next, we can solve the equation",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Total number of cakes needed = 20 large cakes + 700 small cakes = 720 cakes
2. Each large cake takes 2 hours to prepare, so we need 20 large cakes to be prepared in 3 hours = 10 large cakes per hour.
3. Each small cake takes 35 minutes to prepare, so we need 700 small cakes to be prepared in 3 hours = 200 small cakes per hour.
4. Total time required to prepare all the cakes = 10 large cakes per hour x 1 hour = 10 hours + 200 small cakes per hour x 1 hour = 1 hour = 11 hours.
5. Number of helpers required = Total number of cakes / Time required to prepare each cake = 720 cakes / 11 hours = 65.45 (rounded off to the nearest integer) = 66 helpers.

Answer Choices:
A) 6
B) 7
C) 8
D) 9
E) 10
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by using the fact that U is the midpoint of ST . This means that the distance between U and S is equal to the distance between U and T .

We know that the distance between R and S is 5, and the distance between R and T is 17. So, the distance between U and T is half of 17, which is 8.5.

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the distances between points R, S, and T is equal to the length of the line segment ST . So, we can set up the equation:

5 + 8.5 + x = 22

where x is the distance between U and R.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 22 - 5 - 8.5 = 8

So, the length of the line segment RU is 8. The answer is C.",A

D) 33 %
E) 18 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The shopkeeper sold the items at a discount of 20% for one day, so the selling price of each item was:

Original Price x (1 - 0.20) = Original Price x 0.80

2. To find the new price of each item after the discount, we need to multiply the original price by 0.80:

New Price = Original Price x 0.80

3. Now, the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at the original price the next day, so he needs to increase the new price by the same amount as the discount he offered the previous day:

New Price + 0.20(New Price) = Original Price

4. Simplifying the equation, we get:

New Price + 0.20(New Price) = Original Price

0.80(New Price) + 0.20(New Price) = 1.00

5. Solving for New Price, we get:

New Price = 1.20

So, the shopkeeper needs to increase the price of each item by 20% to original price to sell them at the original price the next day.

The answer is:

A) 21%

Explanation:

The shopkeeper increased the price of each item by 20% to original price to sell them at the original price the next day. This means that the price of each item was increased by 20% of the original price, which is 20% of 1.00, or 0.20. Therefore, the new price of each item is 1.20, which is the original price plus 20% of the original price.",C

E) ( 13 x - 12) / 24
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have a straight picket fence composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

We can start by finding the total width of the fence, which is the sum of the width of each picket:

Total width = x pickets x width of one picket
= x x / 2

Since there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, we can subtract the space between each pair of pickets from the total width:

Total width - space between pickets = x x / 2 - 6

Now, we can simplify the expression:

x x / 2 - 6 = (x / 2) - 3

Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert the length of the fence to feet:

(x / 2) - 3 = (x / 2) - (12 / 2)

= (x / 2) - 6

So, the length of the fence in feet is:

The answer is C) 13 x / 24.",E

C) 200
D) 287
E) 187
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The ship travels 180 miles, so the distance it has traveled is 180 miles.
2. The plane starts with 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10 x 180 miles/hour = 1800 miles/hour.
3. The time it takes for the plane to catch up to the ship is:

distance / speed = time

180 miles / 1800 miles/hour = 0.1 hours

So the plane catches up to the ship in 0.1 hours, or 6 minutes.

4. The distance the plane travels is:

distance = speed x time

1800 miles/hour x 0.1 hours = 180 miles

So the plane travels 180 miles.

5. The total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is:

total distance = ship distance + plane distance

180 miles + 180 miles = 360 miles

C) 5000
D) 6000
E) 7500
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we know that 200 deer were caught in 2001 and 500 deer were caught in 2002. We also know that 20 of the deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year.

Let's assume that the total deer population in the forest in 2001 was x. We know that 300 deer were caught and tagged in 2001, so the number of deer in the forest without tags in 2001 was x - 300.

In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and 20 of them had tags from the previous year. This means that the number of deer in the forest without tags in 2002 was 500 - 20 = 480.

Now, we can set up a proportion to represent the situation:

Proportion:

x / (x - 300) = 480 / 20

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

x = 4800

So, the total deer population in the forest in 2001 was 4800. The answer is E.

C) 0.6
D) 0.65
E) 1.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, so the first train on the main line starts at 5:00 AM.
2. The harbor line starts at 5:02 AM, so the first train on the harbor line starts 2 minutes after the first train on the main line.
3. The frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, so the next train on the main line will be at 5:10 AM, and the next train on the harbor line will be at 5:12 AM.
4. Therefore, the man can catch either the first train on the main line (5:00 AM) or the first train on the harbor line (5:02 AM).

The answer is:

B) 0.8

Explanation:
There are two trains, and the man can catch either of them. Since the main line train starts at 5:00 AM and the harbor line train starts at 5:02 AM, the man has a 2/3 chance of catching the main line train (5:00 AM) and a 1/3 chance of catching the harbor line train (5:02 AM).

If that projection were to come true , the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago . Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year ?
Answer Choices:
A) 20 %
B) 40 %
C) 50 %
D) 65 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.
2. The population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago.

Now, let's assume the current population of Boomtown is x.

1. After one year, the population will be x + 10% of x = x + 0.1x = 1.1x.
2. After two years, the population will be 1.1x + 10% of 1.1x = 1.1x + 0.1(1.1x) = 2.2x.

Since the population two years from now is expected to be exactly double the population of one year ago, we can set up the equation:

2.2x = 2x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1.1

So, the current population of Boomtown is 1.1 million.

Now, we can find the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year:

Percent population increase = (1.1 - 1) / 1 = 0.1 or 10%

The answer is A) 20%. The population of Boomtown increased by 10% over the last year.</s>The answer is A) 20%.",D

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.

Now, let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have x + 30 dollars, and Arjun will have x - 30 dollars.
2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have x + 10 dollars, and Sajal will have y - 10 dollars.

Now, we can solve the system of equations:

1. x + 30 = 2y (Sajal has twice the money left with Arjun)
2. x + 10 = 3y (Arjun has thrice as much as is left with Sajal)

Solving the system, we get:

x = 42
y = 62

So, Arjun has $42 and Sajal has $62.

Answer Choices:
A) 242
B) 308
C) 352
D) 412
E) 456
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The least common multiple (LCM) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that both integers divide into without leaving a remainder. Since the greatest common factor (GCF) is 11, we know that both integers must be divisible by 11.

Let's assume that one of the integers is x. Then, the other integer must be x + 11, since the LCM is the product of the two integers and we know that the GCF is 11.

So, we can write the equation:

x(x + 11) = 7700

Now, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 11:

11x(x + 11) = 7700

11x^2 + 11x = 7700

We can factor this equation as:

(11x + 11)(x) = 7700

So, we have two possible solutions:

x = 352 and x = 456

Since the LCM is 7700, we know that both integers must be relatively prime, meaning they do not have any common factors other than 1. Therefore, we can rule out x = 456, since 456 is not relatively prime to 352.

If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet , what was the perimeter ( in feet ) of the original piece of square cloth ?
Answer Choices:
A) 56
B) 58
C) 60
D) 62
E) 64
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet. Since the triangles are similar, we can use the area formula for a triangle:

Area = (base x height) / 2

Since the triangles are congruent, we can use the same base and height for both triangles. Let's call the base of each triangle ""b"" and the height ""h"".

Area = (b x h) / 2

We know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

(b x h) / 2 = 70

Now, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 2 to get:

b x h = 140

Since the triangles are similar, we know that the ratio of the base to the height is the same for both triangles. So, we can set up a proportion:

b/h = 140/70

Now, we can simplify the proportion by cross-multiplying and simplifying:

b/h = 2

Now we can find the base and height of each triangle. Since the triangles are similar, we know that the base and height of each triangle are the same. So, we can find the base and height of one triangle and use it to find the base and height of the other triangle.

Let's assume that the base of one triangle is ""b"" and the height is ""h"". Then, we can find the area of that triangle:

Area = (b x h) / 2

Area = (b x h) / 2 = 70

Now, we can solve for ""b"" and ""h"":

b x h = 140

b = 140 / h

b = 2

h = 140 / b

h = 2

Now we know that the base of each triangle is 2 and the height is 2. So, the perimeter of the original square cloth is:

Perimeter = 2 x (2 + 2)

Perimeter = 2 x 4

Perimeter = 8

B) 30
C) 6
D) 15
E) 12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm, so we can start by writing that down:

30 cm

Now, we know that the ribbon was reduced in the ratio 5:3, which means that we need to find a new length that is 5/3 of the original length.

To do this, we can use the ratio to set up a proportion:

30 cm / 3 = 5 cm / 5

Now we can simplify this by multiplying both sides by 3:

30 cm / 3 = 5 cm / 5 x 3

This gives us:

30 cm = 5 cm x 3

Now we can simplify further by multiplying both sides by 3:

30 cm = 5 cm x 3 x 3

This gives us:

30 cm = 15 cm x 3

So the length of the ribbon after it was reduced in the ratio 5:3 is 15 cm.

The answer is C. The length of the ribbon after it was reduced in the ratio 5:3 is 15 cm.",A

A) 20
B) 30
C) 40
D) 200
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C.

Let's break down the given information:

M = abc is a three-digit number, so we know that M has 3 digits.

N = cba, so N has 3 digits as well.

M > N, which means that the hundreds digit of M is greater than the hundreds digit of N.

M - N + 396c = 990, which means that the hundreds digit of M is 990 - 396c.

Since M is greater than N, the hundreds digit of M is greater than the hundreds digit of N. Therefore, the hundreds digit of M is greater than 396c.

Now, we need to find out how many values of M are greater than 300.

There are 100 possible values for the hundreds digit of M (00-99). Since M is greater than 300, we know that the hundreds digit of M must be greater than 300.

Therefore, the number of values of M that are greater than 300 is:

100 - 300 + 1 = 40

Answer Choices:
A) 37
B) 41
C) 40
D) 42
E) 43
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say Raj was x years old 5 years ago, so Raj's age 5 years ago was x - 5.

We know that Raj is currently 17 years old, so Raj's current age is 17.

We also know that Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 1/3(Rahim's age 5 years ago)

Now, we need to find Rahim's age 5 years ago. Let's assume Rahim's age 5 years ago was y years old.

So, we can substitute y for Rahim's age 5 years ago in the equation:

x - 5 = 1/3(y)

Now, we can solve for y:

y = 3x/2

Now, we can substitute x = 17 (Raj's current age) and solve for y:

y = 3(17)/2

y = 3 x 17/2

y = 51

So, Rahim's age 5 years ago was 51 years old.

C) 2 % Loss
D) 3 % Loss
E) 4 % Loss
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's first find the cost price of the book.

Profit = 10% of selling price

Profit = 10/100 x Rs 27.50

Profit = Rs 2.75

Now, we can find the cost price by subtracting the profit from the selling price:

Cost price = Selling price - Profit

Cost price = Rs 27.50 - Rs 2.75

Cost price = Rs 24.75

If the book were sold for Rs 25.75, the profit would be:

Profit = Rs 25.75 - Rs 24.75

Profit = Rs 1

The percentage of profit is:

Profit percentage = (Profit / Cost price) x 100

Profit percentage = (Rs 1 / Rs 24.75) x 100

Profit percentage = 4%

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: The bill for the month with 540 calls is Rs 1800, so the fixed charge is Rs 1800 - Rs 1560 = Rs 240. The variable charge is Rs 240 / 540 = Rs 4.5 per call.

For the month with 620 calls, the variable charge is Rs 4.5 x 620 = Rs 2790, so the total bill is Rs 2790 + Rs 240 = Rs 3030.

For the month with 500 calls, the variable charge is Rs 4.5 x 500 = Rs 2250, so the total bill is Rs 2250 + Rs 240 = Rs 2490.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.
2. The cost of a Sunday paper is $4.
3. The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.

Now, let's calculate the number of papers the hotel buys on Monday:

1. First, we'll calculate the number of papers the hotel buys on Sunday:

2 x (number of papers on Sunday) = 2 x 4 = 8

So, the hotel buys 8 papers on Sunday.

2. Now, we'll calculate the total number of papers the hotel buys per week:

8 (Sunday) + (number of papers on Monday) = 210 (weekly cost)

Solving for the number of papers on Monday:

8 + (number of papers on Monday) = 210

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

(number of papers on Monday) = 210 - 8

(number of papers on Monday) = 202

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The area of the rectangle is given as 27 cm x 17 cm = 469 cm^2.

To form a square, we need to make all four sides equal. Let's call the side of the square ""s"".

The area of the square is s^2, so we can set up the equation:

469 = s^2

Now, we can solve for s:

s = sqrt(469) = 22

We know that the total number of sweets in the bag is 120, so we can set up the equation:

3x + 4x = 120

Simplifying the equation:

7x = 120

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the age of the youngest member is x. Then the age of the next member would be x + 3, and so on.

We know that the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x + 3 + 3) + ... + (x + 3 + ... + 3) = 250

Since there are 25 members in the club, we can write:

x + 24(3) = 250

Simplifying the equation:

3x + 72 = 250

Solving for x:

3x = 250 - 72

3x = 178

x = 59

So the youngest member is 59 - 3 = 56 years old.

D) 2 pm on the next day
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am, so it covers a distance of 500 km in 11 am + 12 pm = 2 hours.
2. Train B leaves Mumbai Central at 2 pm, so it covers a distance of 500 km in 2 pm + 3 pm = 3 hours.
3. Since both trains are running on the same route, they cover the same distance in the same time.
4. Therefore, the time at which the two trains meet each other is when Train A has covered 500 km in 2 hours, and Train B has covered 500 km in 3 hours.
5. We know that Train A covers 40 km per hour, so it takes 500 / 40 = 12.5 hours to cover 500 km.
6. Similarly, Train B covers 72 km per hour, so it takes 500 / 72 = 7 hours to cover 500 km.
7. Since Train A takes 12.5 hours to cover 500 km, and Train B takes 7 hours to cover 500 km, they will meet each other after 12.5 - 7 = 5.5 hours.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
2. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of water lilies will double from 1 to 2, from 2 to 4, from 4 to 8, and so on.
3. Since there are initially 64 water lilies on the lake, the number of water lilies after 2 days is 64 x 2 = 128.
4. The number of water lilies after 4 days is 128 x 2 = 256.
5. The number of water lilies after 6 days is 256 x 2 = 512.
6. The number of water lilies after 8 days is 512 x 2 = 1024.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 5.

To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose 4 of the 5 points (A, B, C, D, E, and F). There are 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 possible combinations. However, we need to exclude the case where all 5 points are on the same side of F, as that would form a polygon with fewer than 4 sides.

So, we need to divide 120 by 5, which gives us 24. But we have already excluded one case (all 5 points on the same side of F), so the correct answer is 24 - 1 = 23.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C.

Let's start by using the fact that the sum of the measures of the minor arcs is equal to the angle of the central angle that bisects them.

Minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°, so the sum of their measures is:

160° + 150° = 310°

Since B bisects minor arc AC, we know that BD is the central angle that bisects AC. Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is:

310° - 160° = 150°

1. 75% of the employees take a winter vacation.
2. 40% take both winter and summer vacations.
3. 20% take neither winter nor summer vacations.

Now, let's find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:

1. 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, so 75% of the remaining employees (i.e., 25%) do not take a winter vacation.
2. 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, so 40% of the remaining employees (i.e., 60%) take only a summer vacation.
3. 20% of the employees take neither winter nor summer vacations, so 20% of the remaining employees (i.e., 80%) take either a winter or a summer vacation.

Now, we can calculate the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:

(60% of 25%) + (80% of 25%) = (60% x 25%) + (80% x 25%)
= 15% + 20%

B) 28
C) 21
D) 80
E) 23
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by identifying the formula for the area of a trapezium:

Area = (b1 + b2) \* h / 2

where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides, and h is the height of the trapezium.

In this case, we know that the width of the canal at the top is 10 m, and the width at the bottom is 6 m. Let's call the height of the trapezium h.

We also know that the area of the cross-section is 640 square meters. So we can set up the equation:

640 = (10 + 6) \* h / 2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

640 = 16 \* h / 2

Now, dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

320 = h

So the depth of the canal is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the number of matches the team played during the season is x.

We know that the team won 20 matches, so the number of matches they lost is 30% of x, or 0.3x.

We also know that the team lost 30 matches, so we can set up the equation:

0.3x = 30

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 30 / 0.3

x = 100

So, the team played 100 matches during the season.

D) 3000 pi
E) 7500 pi
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 1875 pi.

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the distance traveled by a point on a circular path:

distance = (revolutions x radius) / 100

In this case, the revolutions per minute is 300, and the radius of the fan blade is 10 centimeters.

So, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is:

distance = (300 x 10) / 100
= 3000 / 100
= 30

Therefore, the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 30 centimeters.

Note that the answer is C) 1875 pi, which is the distance traveled in centimeters after 30 seconds, not the distance traveled in revolutions per minute.",D

C) 25 < x < 64
D) 28 < x < 60
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have the equation x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4).

First, let's analyze the expression inside the parentheses. We have:

n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16

= n^2 + 2n + 8 + 16

= n^2 + 2n + 24

Now, we can see that the expression is always positive for 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, since n^2 is always positive and 2n is always positive for n ≥ 3. Additionally, 24 is always positive.

So, the equation x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4) is always positive for 36 ≤ n ≤ 72.

Now, let's find the range of values for x. We can do this by solving for x in terms of n.

We have:

x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16) / (n + 4√n + 4)

= (n^2 + 2n + 24) / (n + 4n + 16)

= (n + 24) / (n + 4n + 16)

Now, we can see that the denominator is always positive for 36 ≤ n ≤ 72, since n + 4n + 16 is always positive. Therefore, the numerator must also be positive.

So, the answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) 50 m
B) 75 m
C) 100 m
D) 125 m
E) 150 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Okay! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The space shuttle can travel 700 m high in 40 seconds, so its vertical velocity is:

700 m / 40 s = 17.5 m/s

2. Since it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, the horizontal velocity is:

5 s / 40 s = 1/8 (or 12.5%) of the total velocity

3. Therefore, the total velocity is:

17.5 m/s x 12.5% = 2.1875 m/s

4. Now, we can find the length of the space shuttle using the formula:

distance = velocity x time

In this case, the distance is the height it travels (700 m), and the time is the time it takes to pass a point (5 seconds). So, we can plug in the values:

distance = 700 m x 2.1875 m/s = 1512.5 m

The answer is C) 150 m.",C

At the end of the year , out of a total profit of Rs . 375,000 , C gets Rs . 150,000 as his share . How many months after B joined the business , did C join ?
Answer Choices:
A) 2 months
B) 4 months
C) 23 months
D) 24 months
E) 84 months
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. A starts with Rs. 40,000.
2. B joins with Rs. 60,000 after 2 months.
3. C joins with Rs. 120,000 after some more time.
4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs. 375,000.
5. C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share.

Let's assume that C joins after x months after B joined.

We know that A had Rs. 40,000 at the start, and B joined with Rs. 60,000 after 2 months. So, after 2 months, A had Rs. 40,000 + 60,000 = Rs. 100,000.

Now, let's consider the contribution of C:

C joins after x months, and the total profit at the end of the year is Rs. 375,000. So, C's contribution would be:

Rs. 120,000 x (12 - x) months

where x is the number of months C joins after B.

We know that C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share, so we can set up the following equation:

Rs. 120,000 x (12 - x) = Rs. 150,000

Now, we can solve for x:

120,000 x (12 - x) = 150,000

120,000 x 12 = 150,000 x x

x = 24

So, C joins the business 24 months after B joined.

B) 8.79
C) 8.75
D) 8.71
E) 8.72
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The area of the semi-circles is given by:

Area of semi-circle = (1/2)r^2

where r is the radius of the semi-circle. Since the semi-circles are drawn on the opposite sides of the square, the radius of each semi-circle is half the length of the side of the square, which is 20 cm.

So, the area of each semi-circle is:

Area of semi-circle = (1/2)(20/2)^2 = 80 cm^2

Since there are two semi-circles, the total area of the semi-circles is:

Total area of semi-circles = 2 x 80 cm^2 = 160 cm^2

Now, we need to find the area of the remaining paper. The paper is a square, so its area is simply the length of its side squared:

Area of remaining paper = side^2

Since the side of the square is 20 cm, the area of the remaining paper is:

Area of remaining paper = 20^2 = 400 cm^2

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 400 cm^2.",C

E) M + N / 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so their speed is:

M / 4 = miles/hour

2. The athlete rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so their speed is:

N / 4 = miles/hour

3. We want to find the average speed for both activities combined, so we need to find a way to combine the two speeds.

Let's add the two speeds:

M / 4 + N / 4 = (miles/hour)

4. Now, we can simplify the expression:

M / 4 + N / 4 = (miles/hour)

M + N / 4 = (miles/hour)

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 270.

Let's break down the information given:

1. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
2. He turned right around with a pause and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
3. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.

We know that the total distance traveled by Kevin is the sum of the distance traveled from A to B and the distance traveled from B back to A.

Distance from A to B = 70 mph x 3 hours = 210 miles

Distance from B back to A = 90 mph x 3 hours = 270 miles

Therefore, the total distance traveled by Kevin is 210 + 270 = 480 miles.

The distance between A and B is half of the total distance traveled, which is 480 / 2 = 270 miles.

B) 84
C) 21
D) 24
E) 25
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B) 84.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. If 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to its one-third.
2. So, the number before subtracting 30 is 3 times the number after subtracting 30.
3. If the number after subtracting 30 is x, then the number before subtracting 30 is 3x.
4. Since 50% of the number before subtracting 30 is 3x/2, the 50% of the number after subtracting 30 is (3x/2) - 30.
5. Therefore, the 50% of the original number is (3x/2) - 30.

Now, we can choose the value of x. Let's assume x = 100.

100 - 30 = 70

70 / 2 = 35

So, the 50% of the original number is 35 - 30 = 5.

Answer Choices:

C) 12 kmph
D) 14 kmph
E) 6 kmph
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let's say the man rows at a rate of x kmph in still water.

When he rows against the current, his rate is 2 kmph less than his rate in still water, so his rate against the current is x - 2 kmph.

We know that the man's total distance traveled is the sum of his distance traveled in still water and his distance traveled against the current:

Distance = Distance in still water + Distance against the current

We can set up an equation based on this:

x + (x - 2) = ?

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 2 = ?

Solving for x:

2x = 14

x = 7

So, the man's rate in still water is 7 kmph, and his rate against the current is 7 - 2 = 5 kmph.

The answer is C) 12 kmph.",E

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

From the problem statement, we know that the sum of the digits of the three-digit number is 17, so we can write:

a + b + c = 17

where a, b, and c are the digits of the number.

We also know that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so we can write:

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

Now, we are given that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order. So, we can write:

x - 495 = a + b + c

where x is the original number and a, b, and c are its digits.

D) 59 : 91
E) 69 : 101
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start with the information given:

* Alloy X is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9.
* Alloy Y is made by mixing zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11.
* 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z.

First, let's find the amount of zinc and copper in each alloy:

For alloy X:
6/10 = 60% zinc, 40% copper

For alloy Y:
7/11 = 63.6% zinc, 36.4% copper

Now, let's find the total amount of zinc and copper in the mixture of the two alloys:

Total zinc = 60% of 40 + 63.6% of 60 = 24.4 + 38.4 = 62.8 grams
Total copper = 40% of 40 + 36.4% of 60 = 16 + 21.6 = 37.6 grams

Now, let's find the ratio of zinc to copper in the mixture:

Ratio of zinc to copper = (62.8 / 37.6) = 1.71

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to the bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes $4,000.
Their total allows them to influence 30 senators.

We can start by finding out how much Hoopsmot can influence on his own. Since he contributes $16,000, he can influence 16 x 3 = 48 senators.

Now, we need to find out how many senators Smolapon can influence on his own. Since he contributes $4,000, he can influence 4 x 3 = 12 senators.

Since Hoopsmot and Smolapon together can influence 30 senators, we can find out the total number of senators that Hoopsmot can influence by adding his influence to Smolapon's influence:

Hoopsmot's influence + Smolapon's influence = 48 + 12 = 60

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 22

Explanation: Hoopsmot can influence 22 senators on his own, and Smolapon can influence 12 senators on his own, for a total of 22 + 12 = 34 senators that they can influence together. Since they can influence 30 senators in total, the remaining 6 senators must be influenced by Hoopsmot.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, which means:

$$(x^2 - y^2) = 256000$$

Since the sum of the numbers is 1000, we can write:

$$x + y = 1000$$

Now, we can solve for x and y:

$$x^2 - y^2 = 256000$$

$$x + y = 1000$$

Solving the first equation for x, we get:

$$x = \sqrt{256000 + 1000} = 628$$

Now, substituting x = 628 into the second equation, we get:

$$628 + y = 1000$$

Solving for y, we get:

$$y = 372$$

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this step by step.

First, we can simplify the expression:

(272 - 32) = 232

(124 + 176) = 296

So the expression becomes:

232(296) / (17 x 15 - 15)

Now, we can calculate the product:

232 x 296 = 66248

Next, we can calculate the factor in parentheses:

17 x 15 - 15 = 17 x 15 = 255

So the expression becomes:

66248 / 255

Which simplifies to:

260

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The bus fare of one adult from Ranchi to Patna is Rs. 140, so the bus fare of one child is half the fare of one adult, which is Rs. 70.

Now, we have 4 adults and 3 children traveling from Ranchi to Patna. The total bus fare of the adults is 4 x Rs. 140 = Rs. 560.

The total bus fare of the children is 3 x Rs. 70 = Rs. 210.

A) 300
B) 200
C) 400
D) 100
E) 500
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The organization needs to raise Rs. 6 lakh.
2. Each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, so the total contribution is Rs. 60 x number of employees.
3. The total contribution with all employees contributing Rs. 60 extra is Rs. 6.24 lakh (60 x 100 = 6000, 6000 x 10 = 60,000).

Now, we can set up a equation:

6000 + (60 x number of employees) = 6.24 lakh

Solving for the number of employees, we get:

6000 + (60 x number of employees) = 6.24 lakh

6000 + 60x = 624000

60x = 624000 - 6000

60x = 618000

x = 618000 / 60

1. First, we know that 20% of 5000 voters are not eligible to vote, so we can subtract that from the total number of voters:

5000 - (20/100) \* 5000 = 5000 - 1000 = 4000

2. Next, we know that the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, so we can calculate the number of votes they received:

If after one dive , she got $ 3.40 . What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought ?
Answer Choices:
A) 4
B) 3
C) 2
D) 1
E) 0
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The diver got $3.40 after one dive.
2. She gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.
3. So, the total amount she got must be equal to the number of copper coins she brought, plus the number of brass coins she brought, multiplied by the amount she gets for each coin.

Now, let's substitute the amounts we know:

3.40 = (number of copper coins) x 20 + (number of brass coins) x 25

Now, we can solve for the number of copper coins:

3.40 = 20x + 25y

Where x is the number of copper coins and y is the number of brass coins.

Now, we can solve for x:

3.40 = 20x + 25y

Subtracting 20y from both sides gives us:

3.40 - 20y = 20x

Now, we can see that 3.40 - 20y is a constant, and we know that 20y is equal to 3.40 / 20, which is 0.17.

So, we can substitute 0.17 for 20y in the previous equation:

3.40 - 0.17 = 20x

Now, we can solve for x:

3.40 - 0.17 = 20x

Adding 0.17 to both sides gives us:

3.57 = 20x

Now, we can divide both sides by 20 to solve for x:

x = 3.57 / 20

x = 0.18

So, the answer is:

The answer is B. 3.

The diver brought 3 copper coins, each worth 20 cents, for a total of 3 x 20 = 60 cents.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time.
2. They travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20 m/s and 40 m/s, respectively.
3. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds.

We can let the distance between A and B be x meters. Since they are traveling at constant speeds, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

For Ram, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 20 m/s x 10 s = 200 meters

For Krishna, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 40 m/s x 10 s = 400 meters

D) 45 kms / hr
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's first calculate the speed of car X:

Distance = 320 km
Time = 8 hours
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 320 km / 8 hrs
Speed = 40 km/hr

Now, let's calculate the speed of car Y:

Distance = 415 km
Time = 5 hours
Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 415 km / 5 hrs
Speed = 83 km/hr

Now, we need to find the difference in the speed of the two cars. We can do this by subtracting the speed of car Y from the speed of car X:

Speed of car X - Speed of car Y = 40 km/hr - 83 km/hr
= -43 km/hr

Answer Choices:
A) 3 hours
B) 5 hours
C) 6 hours
D) 4 hours
E) 7 hours
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, so it covers:

55 miles/hour x time = distance

2. The second car travels at a steady rate of 52 mph, so it covers:

52 miles/hour x time = distance

3. We know that the cars start at the same point and travel in the same direction, so the distance between them will increase at a constant rate.
4. We want to find out how much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other.

Now, let's find the time it takes for the cars to cover 15 miles:

For the first car:

55 miles/hour x time = 15 miles
time = 15 miles / 55 miles/hour = 0.27 hours (approximately 15 minutes)

For the second car:

52 miles/hour x time = 15 miles
time = 15 miles / 52 miles/hour = 0.29 hours (approximately 15 minutes)

Since both cars start at the same point and travel in the same direction, they will be 15 miles away from each other after the same amount of time. Therefore, the answer is:

D) 6 : π
E) 8 : 3
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's dive into this problem.

The volume of a cube with side length x is x^3.

The volume of a sphere with radius x is (4/3)πx^3.

Since the sphere fits inside the cube, we know that the volume of the sphere is less than or equal to the volume of the cube.

So, we can set up the following inequality:

(4/3)πx^3 ≤ x^3

Now, we can simplify this inequality by multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

4πx^3 ≤ 3x^3

Now, we can simplify further by dividing both sides by 3:

4πx ≤ 3x

Now, we can see that the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cube is 4π/3x, which is the same as 8/3.

So, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Since you want at least two ties of the same colour, you should take out at least 2 ties. Let's count the number of ties of each colour:

* Red: 8
* Violet: 13
* Blue: 10
* Pink: 5
* Green: 4

You need at least 2 ties of the same colour, so you should take out at least 2 ties. Let's take out 2 ties of the same colour, and see if we can find a pair.

If we take out 2 ties of the same colour, we have:

* Red: 8 - 2 = 6
* Violet: 13 - 2 = 11
* Blue: 10 - 2 = 8
* Pink: 5 - 2 = 3
* Green: 4 - 2 = 2

Now, let's check if we can find a pair of ties of the same colour:

* Red: 6 - 2 = 4 (no pair)
* Violet: 11 - 2 = 9 (no pair)
* Blue: 8 - 2 = 6 (no pair)

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost price of one kilogram of oranges:

Cost price per kg = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5 per kg

Now, we can calculate the selling price per kg:

Selling price per kg = Rs. 7.50 per kg

Now, we can calculate the total profit:

Profit = (Selling price per kg - Cost price per kg) x Total quantity
= (Rs. 7.50 per kg - Rs. 5 per kg) x 90 kg

At what time do the 2 trains cross one another ?
Answer Choices:

B) 1 hr 15 min
C) 1 hr 8 min
D) 56 min
E) 55 min
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the situation:

1. Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, so the distance between City A and City B is 9 am - 5 am = 4 hours.
2. Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, so the distance between City B and City A is 10:30 am - 7 am = 3 hours and 30 minutes.
3. Since both trains are traveling in opposite directions, they will cross each other at some point.

Now, we need to find the time at which the two trains cross each other. We know that the distance between City A and City B is 4 hours, and the distance between City B and City A is 3 hours and 30 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation:

4 hours + 3 hours and 30 minutes = 7 hours

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4 + 3.5 = 7

Solving for the time, we get:

The answer is 1 hour and 23 minutes.

Therefore, the two trains cross each other at 1 hour and 23 minutes past 7 am. The answer is A.",D

B) 2890
C) 270
D) 2702
E) 960
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. The candidate secured 504 marks out of the maximum mark M.
2. If the maximum mark M is converted to 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks.

Now, let's convert the given information into equations:

1. 504 = M x x (where x is the number of marks secured by the candidate)
2. 420 = M x x (where x is the number of marks secured by the candidate in the new exam with a maximum mark of 800)

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously:

M x x = 504 (given)
M x x = 420 (given)

Now, we can divide both equations by M to get:

x = 504 / M
x = 420 / M

Now, we can simplify both equations:

x = 504 / M = 420 / M

x = 420 / M

Now, we can solve for M:

M = 420 / x

M = 420 / 420

M = 1

E) 4.4 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The height of the room is 2 times the semi-perimeter, so we can start by finding the semi-perimeter.

The formula for the semi-perimeter of a rectangle is:

semi-perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width.

We know that the width is 50 cm, and the area of the room is 15 sq m, so the length must be:

l = 15 / (50 * 2) = 15 / 100 = 0.15 m

Now we can find the semi-perimeter:

semi-perimeter = 2(l + w) = 2(0.15 + 50) = 2 x 50.15 = 100.3 m

Now we can find the height:

height = 2 x semi-perimeter = 2 x 100.3 = 200.6 m

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The sum of k consecutive integers is given as:

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = 51

We know that the least integer is -50, so we can start counting from there:

-50 + 1 + 2 + ... + k = 51

Now, we can simplify the expression by combining like terms:

k + (1 + 2 + ... + k) = 51

k + k(k+1)/2 = 51

2k + k(k+1)/2 = 51

2k + k^2/2 = 51

k^2/2 + 2k = 51

k^2/2 = 51 - 2k

Now, we need to find the value of k that satisfies the equation.

The answer is C) 82.

The reasoning is as follows:

k^2/2 = 51 - 2k

k^2 = 102

k = 82

Now we can see that one of the factors is (x + 12), which has a root of 1.5. So, we can set the factor equal to 0 and solve for m:

12 + m = 0

m = -12

C) 10 ! / 2
D) 10 ! / 4
E) 10 ! / 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: There are 10 speakers in total, and each speaker has to speak before the next one. So, the order of the speakers is important.

First, the PM speaks, then the MP, and finally the MLA.

Since the PM speaks before the MP, there are 9 possible speakers before the PM (the MP and the MLA).

So, the number of ways to arrange the speakers is 9! = 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 362,880.

However, not all of these arrangements are valid, as some of them would have the PM speaking before the MP, which is not allowed.

To avoid this, we need to subtract the number of arrangements where the PM speaks before the MP.

There are 9 possible speakers before the PM, and each of them can speak in 2 possible orders (either before or after the MP). So, the number of invalid arrangements is 9 × 2 = 18.

Therefore, the total number of valid arrangements is 362,880 - 18 = 362,862.

E) $ 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, we know that the original price of each article was $100, so the old price of each article was $100.

Next, we know that the price of each article decreased by 15%, so we can calculate the new price of each article as follows:

New price = Old price x (1 - 0.15)

New price = $100 x (1 - 0.15)

New price = $100 x 0.85

New price = $85

So, the new selling price of each article is $85. The answer is A.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 10.

Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. We have 28 white tulips, and we need to use all of them.
2. We have 98 red tulips, and we need to use all of them.
3. Since no flowers are to be left out, we need to make sure that each bouquet has an equal number of white and red tulips.
4. The maximum number of bouquets we can make is 10, since we have a total of 127 tulips (28 + 98).
5. To make each bouquet, we need to distribute the tulips equally between the two types.
6. Since there are 28 white tulips, we can make 28/2 = 14 bouquets with 14 white tulips each.
7. Since there are 98 red tulips, we can make 98/2 = 49 bouquets with 49 red tulips each.

If the farms are 75 cm away from each other , what will be the distance ( in cm ) that ant A travels until meeting ant B ?
Answer Choices:
A) 45
B) 48
C) 51
D) 54
E) 57
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm/hr, so it will cover 9 cm in one hour.
2. Ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm/hr, so it will cover 6 cm in one hour.
3. The distance between the farms is 75 cm.

Now, we need to find out how long it will take for Ant A to meet Ant B. We can do this by dividing the distance between the farms by the speed of Ant B:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 75 cm / 6 cm/hr

Time = 12.5 hours

So, Ant A will meet Ant B after 12.5 hours.

Now, we need to find out how far Ant A will travel before meeting Ant B. We can do this by multiplying the speed of Ant A by the time it takes to meet Ant B:

Distance = Speed x Time

Distance = 9 cm/hr x 12.5 hours

Distance = 112.5 cm

The answer is C) 51 cm.",A

Simplifying, we get:

42 = 75% x Cover Price

Now, we can solve for the cover price:

Cover Price = 42 / 75%

2. If the coin lands on tails, Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher, so the total amount Jonathan has given is 3 x 20 = $60.
3. Since neither of them won or lost any amount, we can set up the equation:

$40 + $60 = 0

4. Solving for the equation, we get:

20 x (2 + 3) = 0

20 x 5 = 0

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Allen starts from X and goes to Y, so he covers half the distance between X and Y.
2. Bob starts from Y and goes towards X, so he covers half the distance between Y and X.
3. When Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X, so he covers half the distance between Y and X.
4. When Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y, so he covers half the distance between X and Y.

Since Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78 kmph, we can find the distance they cover in the same amount of time:

54 kmph x 2 = 108 km (Allen's distance)
78 kmph x 2 = 156 km (Bob's distance)

1. The bond has a face value of $5,000, and it pays an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months.
2. Since the interest is compounded every six months, there are two interest periods per year.
3. The interest for each period is calculated as follows:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

where Principal is the face value of the bond ($5,000), Rate is the annual interest rate (12%), and Time is the length of the interest period (6 months).

4. The total interest accrued over one year is the sum of the interest for each of the two interest periods:

Total Interest = Interest for 1st period + Interest for 2nd period

5. Now we can calculate the interest for each period:

Interest for 1st period = $5,000 x 12% x 6/12 = $200
Interest for 2nd period = $5,000 x 12% x 6/12 = $200

6. The total interest accrued over one year is:

Total Interest = $200 + $200 = $400

Answer Choices:
A) 18
B) 25
C) 15
D) 20
E) 21
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say Sachin's age 10 years back was x. Then, Sachin's current age is x + 10.

We know that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back, so Ajay's age 10 years back was half of Sachin's age, which is x / 2.

Now, we know that Ajay's current age is x / 2 + 10.

We are given that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so Sachin's future age will be:

x + 10 + 10 = 40

Simplifying, we get:

2x + 20 = 40

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

2x = 20

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 10

So, Ajay's current age is:

x / 2 + 10 = 10 / 2 + 10 = 5 + 10 = 15

Answer Choices:
A) 3400
B) 1700
C) 3440
D) Can not be determined
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B) 1700.

To find the cost of gardening the 1-meter wide boundary, we need to calculate the area of the boundary first.

The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 340 meters, so the length of the boundary must be 340 - 2(10) = 340 - 20 = 320 meters.

The area of the boundary is therefore 320 x 1 = 320 square meters.

Since the rate is given as 10 per square meter, the cost of gardening the 1-meter wide boundary is 320 x 10 = 3200.

However, we are asked to garden a 1-meter broad boundary, so we need to divide the cost by 2 to get the cost per meter:

3200 / 2 = 1600

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

* 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels.
* Of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies.

So, if we subtract the revenue from novels from the total revenue, we get:

Total revenue - Novel revenue = Biographical revenue

36% of the total revenue is from biographies (1/3 of the remaining revenue).

Now, we can set up a ratio to compare the revenue from novels to the revenue from biographies:

Novel revenue : Biographical revenue = 34% of total revenue : 36% of total revenue

Simplifying the ratio, we get:

1:1.3

So, the answer is:

The answer is B. The revenue from novels is 1.3 times the revenue from biographies.",B

a. 2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2

We can start by simplifying the numerator and denominator of the fraction inside the parentheses.

2 - b 2 = 2 - (b^2)

= 2 - (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)

= 2 - (a^2 + 2ab)

Now we can see that the numerator and denominator of the fraction are both perfect squares, so we can take the square root of both sides.

(a + b) 2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

= (a + b)^2

So the question mark should be replaced with:

C) 23 min
D) 21 min
E) 20 min
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say that A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so A's efficiency is 40/60 = 2/3.

Let's say that B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so B's efficiency is 45/60 = 3/4.

If both A and B work together, their combined efficiency would be the average of their individual efficiencies:

(2/3 + 3/4) = (2 + 3)/6 = 5/6

So, the combined efficiency of A and B is 5/6.

Now, we know that the wall can be constructed in 40 minutes by A alone, so the time taken by both A and B together would be:

40/5/6 = 20 minutes

C) 20 seconds
D) 33 seconds
E) 55 seconds
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means it spends 3 seconds accelerating to its maximum speed.
2. The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, so it covers 1 mile in 1/120 hour = 0.008333 hours (or approximately 0.01 hours).
3. Since the train spends 3 seconds entering the tunnel, it spends 0.01 hours x 120 miles/hour = 1.2 miles inside the tunnel.
4. Therefore, the total time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is 3 seconds + 1.2 miles / 120 miles per hour = 3 + 0.01 hours x 120 = 3 + 0.01 x 120 = 3 + 12 = 15 seconds.

D) 215.67
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The invoice is for $20,000 with terms 4/30, n/100, which means the merchant has to pay 4% of the amount as down payment (4/30) and the remaining amount (n/100) after a certain period of time (n).

To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to find the highest rate at which the amount (n) will be equal to the down payment (4/30) of the amount.

Let's say the amount (n) is x. Then, we can write the equation:

4/30 = x / 100

C) 7
D) 6
E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let's say the amount of rice is 3 pounds, so the amount of wheat and corn would be 3 x 2/3 = 2 pounds and 3 x 5/3 = 5 pounds, respectively.

So, the total amount of cereal in the bag is 3 + 2 + 5 = 10 pounds.

Now, we can find the ratio of corn to the total amount of cereal:

Corn : Total = 5 : 10

To find the answer, we can set up a proportion:

5 : 10 = x : 100

where x is the amount of corn in pounds.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 50

So, the answer is B. The bag contains 7.5 pounds of corn.

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's break down the information given:

1. 10% of produced pens are defective, so the number of defective pens = 10% of 7200 = 720 pens.
2. The company delivers 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each, so the total revenue = 7200 x Rs. 10 = Rs. 72,000.
3. The company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all manufactured pens, so the total profit = 25% of Rs. 72,000 = Rs. 18,000.
4. Since 720 pens are defective, the company needs to subtract the cost of producing those pens.
5. The cost of producing one pen = (7200 - 720) / 7200 = Rs. 6 / 7200 = Rs. 0.0833 (or 8.33%).

Answer Choices:
A) 12
B) 24
C) 42
D) 48
E) 49
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

Let's say the two-digit number is xy, where x is the digit in the ten's place and y is the digit in the unit's place.

We know that the sum of the digits is x + y, and the difference between the sum and the number is 18. So we can set up the equation:

x + y = 18 + xy

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + y = 18 + xy

Now, we know that the digit in the ten's place is twice the digit in the unit's place, so we can substitute y = 2x.

Substituting y = 2x into the equation, we get:

2x + 2x = 18 + x(2x)

Combine like terms:

4x + x = 18 + 2x^2

Now, simplify the equation:

5x = 18 + 2x^2

Subtract 18 from both sides:

5x - 18 = 2x^2

Now, factor the quadratic expression:

(5x - 18) / 2 = x^2

Solve for x:

x = 4

Now that we have found x, we can find y:

y = 2x

So, the answer is:

The answer is 42.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B.

Let's consider the definition of L(x,y) and R(x,y):

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y]
R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

Now, let's assume that x and y are both positive real numbers.

We know that [x] and [y] are both integers, so [x+y] is also an integer.

Since x and y are both positive, [x+y] is also positive.

Therefore, L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] is always an integer.

On the other hand, R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] is not always an integer.

For example, if x = 1 and y = 1/2, then R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = [2] + [2(1/2)] = 3 + 1 = 4, which is not an integer.

Therefore, we cannot find any two positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y). The answer is B.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The electric pole is 14 meters high, and it casts a shadow of 10 meters.
2. The tree is also casting a shadow, and its shadow is 15 meters long.
3. We know that the height of the electric pole is 14 meters, so we can set up a proportion:

Electric pole height : Shadow length = Tree height : Shadow length

We can substitute the values:

14 : 10 = ? : 15

Now, we can solve for the tree height:

? = 14 x 15 / 10

? = 14 x 1.5

? = 21

The answer is 21 meters. The height of the tree is 21 meters.

D) ( ay + by) / x
E) ( a − b) / 2 y
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is A) (ay - by) / 2.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The vertices of the triangle are (a, 0), (b, 0), and (x, y).
2. We know that a > x > b > 0 > y, so we can say that a > x > b > 0.
3. The area of the triangle can be found using the formula: area = (base x height) / 2.
4. The base of the triangle is the distance between the vertex (a, 0) and the vertex (x, y). This distance is x.
5. The height of the triangle is the distance between the vertex (a, 0) and the vertex (b, 0). This distance is y.
6. Therefore, the area of the triangle is (x y) / 2.

B) 12 %
C) 6 %
D) 8 %
E) 4 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B) 12%.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Simple interest is calculated as:

SI = P x R x T

where P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

2. C.I. is calculated as:

C.I. = (P x R x T) + (P x R x T)

where the first term is the simple interest for the first year, and the second term is the simple interest for the second year.

3. We are given that the difference between the simple interest and the C.I. for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72.

So, we can set up the equation:

SI + C.I. = 5000 x 12 x 2 + 5000 x 12 x 2

SI + C.I. = 48,000 + 48,000

SI + C.I. = 96,000

4. Since the difference between the simple interest and the C.I. is Rs. 72, we can subtract Rs. 72 from Rs. 96,000 to find the simple interest:

SI + C.I. - 72 = 96,000 - 72

SI + C.I. = 95,228

5. Finally, we can find the simple interest by subtracting the principal amount from the total interest:

SI = 95,228 - 5000

SI = 90,228

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm . If 50 % of the files were not infected by a virus , how many of Sam ' s files were NOT infected by a worm ?
Answer Choices:
A) 50
B) 70
C) 75
D) 100
E) 125
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

* 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.
* 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is the number of files infected only by a worm.
* 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.

From the first point, we know that the total number of infected files is 250.

From the second point, we know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So, we can set up an equation:

Number of files infected only by a worm = 2.5 x Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm

From the third point, we know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that the number of files not infected by a virus is half of the total number of files, or 125.

Now we can set up another equation:

Number of files not infected by a virus = 125

We can substitute the equation for the number of files infected only by a worm into the equation for the number of files not infected by a virus:

125 = 2.5 x Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm

Now we can solve for the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm:

Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm = 125 / 2.5

Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm = 50

Now we can find the number of files not infected by a worm:

Number of files not infected by a worm = 125 - 50

Number of files not infected by a worm = 75

The answer is C. 75 files were not infected by a worm.",C

B) 2500
C) 2600
D) 2700
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say Mohan's share is x. So, Sohan's share is 5100 - x.

We know that if they invest their shares at 4% per annum, they will receive equal amounts when they turn 26.

So, we can set up the equation:

x / (1 + 0.04)^26 = (5100 - x) / (1 + 0.04)^26

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x / 1.04^26 = 5100 / 1.04^26

Now, we can solve for x.

The answer is C) 2600.

Explanation:

Mohan's share is 2600, and Sohan's share is 5100 - 2600 = 2500.

If they invest their shares at 4% per annum, they will receive equal amounts when they turn 26.",B

Answer Choices:
A) y / ( 1200 xy)
B) 20 xy / w
C) 5 xy / ( 12 w)
D) w / ( 3 xy)
E) 3 y / ( wx)
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So we know that the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. We can start by converting the rate from gallons per second to gallons per minute:

1 minute = 60 seconds

So, w/25 gallons/minute = w/25 x 60 = 25w gallons/minute

Now, we know that y gallons will pass through the drain, so we can set up the equation:

25w = y / x

We are also given that x is the number of seconds it takes for y gallons to pass through the drain. So we can write:

x = y / 25w

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (w and x). Can you solve for w and x?

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver , what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum ?
Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The coin made of alloy is 2 mm thick and has a diameter of 15 mm, so its volume is:

Volume = π x (15 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 30π mm^3

2. The weight of the coin is 30 grams, so the weight of the aluminum in the alloy is:

Weight of aluminum = 30 grams x (volume of aluminum / volume of alloy) = 30 grams x (30π mm^3 / (2 x 15 mm)^3) = 30 grams x (30 / 27) = 30 grams x 1.11 = 33.3 grams

3. Since the weight of the silver in the alloy is twice the weight of the aluminum, the weight of the silver is:

Weight of silver = 2 x 33.3 grams = 66.6 grams

4. Now, let's calculate the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with the same diameter as the coin made of alloy:

Weight of pure aluminum coin = (1 x 30 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 30π mm^3 x 2 mm = 60π mm^3

Since the volume of the pure aluminum coin is 60π mm^3, and the weight of the aluminum in the alloy is 33.3 grams, we can find the weight of the pure aluminum coin as follows:

Weight of pure aluminum coin = 60π mm^3 x (1 / 33.3 grams/mm^3) = 60π mm^3 x 3 = 180 grams

The answer is C. The weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with a diameter of 1 x 30 mm would be 180 grams.",B

B) 160
C) 150
D) 210
E) 220
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given that 2/3 of a number is subtracted by 10, we can start by finding 2/3 of the number.

2/3 of a number is equal to 2 x 3/2 = 6/2 = 3.

So, 2/3 of the number is 3.

Now, if we subtract 10 from 3, we get:

3 - 10 = -7

So, the result of subtracting 10 from 2/3 of the number is -7.

Now, we are given that the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.

40 + 1/3 of the number = -7

1/3 of the number = -7 + 40 = 33

The number is 33.

Answer Choices:
A) 9
B) 7
C) 3
D) 8
E) 12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 can be factored as (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0.

So, we need to find the largest integer value of k for which the equation has two distinct real roots.

Let's consider the case when the equation has two distinct real roots. Then, we can write:

x - 3 = 0 and x - 2 = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3 and x = 2

Now, we can substitute the values of x into the original equation to check if it is satisfied:

3^2 - 5(3) + k = 0
2^2 - 5(2) + k = 0

Both equations are satisfied when k = 0.

So, the largest integer value of k for which the equation has two distinct real roots is 0.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km/hr, so she covers 10 km in 1 hour.
2. She stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km, which is equivalent to 1/6 of an hour (10 minutes / 60 minutes = 1/6).
3. Therefore, she covers 15 km in 1 hour and 1/6 hour (15 km / 10 km/hr + 1/6 hour).
4. To cover 100 km, she will need to ride for 100 / 15 km = 6.67 hours (100 km / 15 km/hr).
5. Since she stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km, she will actually ride for 6.67 hours + (6.67 hours x 1/6) = 6.67 hours + 1.11 hours = 7.78 hours.

C) 30 %
D) 35 %
E) 40 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 30%.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. At 8:00 am, the dog's bowl is filled with dog food.
2. At 9:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.
3. At 10:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.
4. At noon (12:00 pm), the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.

Since the dog eats exactly once an hour, and there are 4 feeding sessions in total (from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm), the dog consumes a total of 4/3 of the original food in the bowl.

So, the percentage of the original food that is left in the bowl right before the dog begins to eat at noon is:

(4/3) / (100%) = 30%

Answer Choices:
A) 100
B) 120
C) 50
D) 200
E) 80
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. 60% of the people who took the survey were women.
2. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.

We can start by finding out how many women took the survey. Since 60% of the survey takers were women, we can find the number of women by multiplying the total number of survey takers by 60/100:

Total number of survey takers x 60/100 = Number of women

We know that 10 men liked green cars more than red cars, so we can find the total number of men by subtracting the number of men who preferred red cars from the total number of survey takers:

Total number of survey takers - Number of men who preferred red cars = Number of men

Now we can substitute the values we have found into the equation for the number of women:

Total number of survey takers x 60/100 = Number of women

Substituting Total number of survey takers = 100 (since there are always 100% of the survey takers), we get:

100 x 60/100 = Number of women

Simplifying, we get:

100 x 6 = Number of women

Solving for the number of women, we get:

Number of women = 60

Now we can find the total number of survey takers by adding the number of women and the number of men:

Total number of survey takers = Number of women + Number of men

Substituting the value of Number of women, we get:

Total number of survey takers = 60 + Number of men

Now we can find the number of men by substituting the value of Number of men into the equation:

Total number of survey takers = 60 + (10 - 75)

Simplifying, we get:

Total number of survey takers = 60 + 25

Solving for the total number of survey takers, we get:

Total number of survey takers = 85

B) 1
C) 1.25
D) 1.5
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say we have 1 gallon of soft drink, which is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. This means we have:

40% of 1 gallon = 0.4 gallons of orange juice
60% of 1 gallon = 0.6 gallons of water

Total volume of soft drink = 0.4 + 0.6 = 1 gallon

Now, we want to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. This means we need to add more orange juice to the soft drink.

Let x gallons of orange juice be added to the soft drink. Then, the new volume of the soft drink will be:

New volume of soft drink = 0.4 gallons of orange juice + 0.6 gallons of water + x gallons of orange juice

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink, so we set up the equation:

0.6 = (0.4 + x) / 1

Simplifying the equation:

0.6 = 0.4 + x / 1

Solving for x:

x = 0.6 - 0.4

x = 0.2

So, we need to add 0.2 gallons of orange juice to the soft drink to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

The answer is C. 1.25 gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

There are 5 horses in the race, and Mr. Jain selects two of them at random. This means that there are 5 possible outcomes:

1. Mr. Jain selects the first horse and the second horse.
2. Mr. Jain selects the second horse and the third horse.
3. Mr. Jain selects the third horse and the fourth horse.
4. Mr. Jain selects the fourth horse and the fifth horse.
5. Mr. Jain selects the first horse and the fifth horse.

Since there are 5 horses, the probability of selecting any one horse is 1/5.

Now, let's consider the probability of selecting the winning horse. There are 5 horses in the race, and we know that Mr. Jain selects two of them at random. The probability of selecting the winning horse is therefore:

Probability of selecting the winning horse = (1/5) x (1/5) = 1/25

So the answer is:

The answer is B) 2/5.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze the given information:

When dividing 2272 by a 3-digit number N, the remainder is the same as when dividing 875 by N.

Since 2272 and 875 have different remainders when divided by 10 (2272 remainder 2, and 875 remainder 7), we know that the remainder of both numbers when divided by N must be the same.

Let's analyze the remainders of 2272 and 875 when divided by N:

2272 / N = 2272 - N = ... (remainder 2)
875 / N = 875 - N = ... (remainder 7)

Since the remainders of both numbers when divided by N are the same, we can equate the two expressions:

2272 - N = 875 - N

Subtracting N from both sides gives:

2272 - N - 875 + N = 0

Simplifying:

2N - 1127 = 0

Solving for N:

N = 1127 / 2 = 563

Answer Choices:
A) 44 %
B) 66 %
C) 68 %
D) 72 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say there are x passing students and y failing students. We know that the total number of students is 100, so x + y = 100.

We know that the passing students have an average of 83, so the sum of their scores is 83x.

We also know that the failing students have an average of 55, so the sum of their scores is 55y.

The overall class average is 76, so we can set up the equation:

83x + 55y = 76(100)

Now we can solve for x and y. First, we can isolate x by subtracting 55y from both sides:

83x - 55y = 76(100) - 55y

This simplifies to:

83x = 21(100)

Now we can divide both sides by 100 to solve for x:

x = 21/100

x = 0.21

Now we can find y by substituting x into the equation:

55y + 0.21(100) = 76(100)

This simplifies to:

55y = 76(100) - 0.21(100)

55y = 7600 - 21

55y = 7389

Now we can divide both sides by 55 to solve for y:

y = 7389/55

y = 135

Now we know that x = 21 and y = 135.

The percentage of students who passed is:

(21/100) x 100% = 21%

The answer is B. The percentage of students who passed is 66%.",E

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. The average wage for the fortnight is $90 per day.
2. The average wage for the first 7 days was $87 per day.
3. The average wage for the last 7 days was $92 per day.

We can calculate the total wage for the first 7 days:

7 days x $87 per day = $606

And the total wage for the last 7 days:

7 days x $92 per day = $654

Total wage for the fortnight:

$606 + $654 = $1260

Now, we can calculate the wage for the 8th day:

$1260 / 15 days = $84 per day

So we know that the two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, and if 9 is subtracted from each number, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.

Let's say the smaller number is x, so the larger number is 3x + 9.

When we subtract 9 from both numbers, we get:

x - 9 = 12
3x + 9 - 9 = 23

Simplifying these equations, we get:

x - 9 = 12
3x = 23 - 9

Solving for x, we get:

x = 21

Answer Choices:
A) 40
B) 60
C) 70
D) 80
E) 90
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let Ajay's present age be x.

If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, the remainder is divided by 18, and the result is Rahul's present age.

So, we can set up the following equation:

x - 6 = 18k + 2

where k is the remainder when x - 6 is divided by 18.

We know that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, so Denis's age is 5 years. Therefore, Rahul's age is 5 - 2 = 3 years.

Now, we can substitute the value of Rahul's age into the equation above:

x - 6 = 18k + 2

3 = 18k

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 18k + 2 + 6

x = 18k + 8

Now, we can substitute the value of k into the equation:

18k + 8 = 3

k = 3 / 18

k = 1

Therefore, Ajay's present age is:

x = 18k + 8

x = 18(1) + 8

x = 18 + 8

x = 26

Answer Choices:
A) 46
B) 81
C) 126
D) 252
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by letting the length of the unpainted side be x feet. Since the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, we know that the sum of the lengths of the two painted sides is 37 - x feet.

The area of the parking space is given by the product of the lengths of all four sides. So we can set up the equation:

x + (37 - x) + (37 - x) + x = 46

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 37 = 46

Subtracting 37 from both sides gives us:

2x = 8

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 4

So the length of the unpainted side is 4 feet. The area of the parking space is:

x + (37 - x) + (37 - x) + x = 4 + 37 + 37 + 4 = 81

The answer is B. The area of the parking space is 81 square feet.",C

E) 4
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

Peter has 10 friends who want to participate in the scavenger hunt, and he wants to form a team of 10 people. This means he has to choose 10 people from his list of friends.

The first person he chooses is already part of the team, so he has 9 friends left to choose from. For the second person, he has 8 friends left to choose from, and so on.

To find the number of choices Peter has for each person, we can use the formula for the number of choices for the last person:

n = n-1 = 9

So, the number of choices for the last person is 9.

Now, we can find the total number of choices by multiplying the number of choices for each person:

Total number of choices = 9 x 9 x 9 x ... x 9 = 9^10

The answer is E) 4. The total number of choices is 4.

Answer Choices:
A) 71
B) 62
C) 43
D) 67
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat is x kg. We know that the weight of the new man is 53 kg.

When the new man replaces the original crew member, the average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat increases by 1.8 kg. This means that the new average weight is x + 1.8 kg.

We also know that the sum of the weights of the 10 oarsmen in the boat remains the same, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10(x + 1.8) = 10x + 10(53)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 18 = 530

Solving for x, we get:

x = 43

So the average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat before the replacement was 43 kg.

Now, we can find the weight of the new man by substituting the value of x into the equation:

53 = 10x + 10(53)

Solving for the new man's weight, we get:

53 = 10(43) + 53

53 = 430 + 53

53 = 483

The answer is B. The weight of the new man is 62 kg.",A

C) 3
D) 4
E) 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Without a membership, the cost of renting a DVD is $4.00.
2. With a membership, the cost of renting a DVD is $2.00.
3. To determine the minimum number of DVDs you would need to rent to make it worth it to purchase a membership, we need to calculate the total cost of renting those DVDs without a membership and compare it to the cost of the membership.

So, let's calculate the total cost of renting DVDs without a membership:

1 DVD x $4.00 = $4.00
2 DVDs x $4.00 = $8.00
3 DVDs x $4.00 = $12.00
4 DVDs x $4.00 = $16.00
5 DVDs x $4.00 = $20.00

As you can see, the cost of renting 5 DVDs without a membership is $20.00, which is more than the cost of the membership ($7.00). So, the minimum number of DVDs you would need to rent to make it worth it to purchase a membership is 5.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, we know that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents. We can start by converting the cost from cents to dollars:

27 x 100 = 2700

So, the cost of 27 bottles of soda is $2700.

Now, we need to find out how much B bottles of soda will cost. We can do this by dividing the cost of 27 bottles by the number of bottles:

$2700 ÷ 27 = $100

So, one bottle of soda costs $100.

To find out how much B bottles of soda will cost, we can simply multiply the cost of one bottle by the number of bottles:

$100 x B = B x $100

The answer is B.

Answer Choices:
A) 8
B) 28
C) 46
D) 66
E) 70
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's first consider the number of ways to select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars:

1. We can select 3 candy bars from the 4 $1 each candy bars, which gives us 4C3 = 6 ways to select 3 candy bars.
2. We can select 3 candy bars from the 4 $2 each candy bars, which gives us 4C3 = 12 ways to select 3 candy bars.
3. We can select 3 candy bars from the 3 $50 each candy bars, which gives us 3C3 = 9 ways to select 3 candy bars.

Total number of ways to select 3 candy bars = 6 + 12 + 9 = 27

Now, we need to find the number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4.

Let's consider the cost of each candy bar:

* 3 $1 each candy bars cost $3
* 4 $2 each candy bars cost $8
* 4 $50 each candy bars cost $200

Total cost of 3 candy bars = $3 + $8 + $200 = $201

So, the number of ways to select 3 candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4 is:

Number of ways to select 3 candy bars = 27

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

There are 4 men and 4 women in the team, so there are a total of 8 people.

Since a team cannot be composed of men only or women only, we need to choose 4 men and 4 women to form the presenter groups.

There are 4! (4 factorial) ways to choose the 4 men, which is 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 24.

Similarly, there are 4! ways to choose the 4 women, which is also 24.

So, the total number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen is 24 x 24 = 576.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say there are x girls in the class. Since exactly 2/5 of the children are girls, we know that the number of girls is 2/5 of the total number of children.

The total number of children in the class is 100 + x (since there are 100 boys and x girls).

So, we can set up the equation:

100 + x = 2/5(100 + x)

Simplifying the equation:

100 + x = 2/5(100 + x)

2/5(100 + x) = 100 + x

Multiplying both sides by 5:

2(100 + x) = 5(100 + x)

100 + x = 500

Solving for x:

x = 400

E) 2 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 4/7.

To see why, let's consider the following:

* A number chosen at random from 1 to 1,000 can be written as ab, where a is the hundreds digit and b is the ones digit.
* Since 1,000 has no factors other than 1 and itself, we know that a and b must both be relatively prime to 1,000.
* Since there are 1,000 possible values for the hundreds digit (1-999), and each of these values can be paired with any of the 10 possible values for the ones digit (1-9), there are a total of 10,000 possible pairs of numbers (1-999 x 1-9 = 10,000).
* However, not all of these pairs are relatively prime, as some of them share common factors. For example, 100 x 99 = 9900, which is not relatively prime to 1,000.
* Therefore, the probability that a number chosen at random from 1 to 1,000 is relatively prime to 1,000 is the number of relatively prime pairs divided by the total number of pairs, or 4/10,000 = 4/7.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. Joe's age, his sister's age, and their father's age sum up to 100.
2. When Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now.
3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as her father.

Let's assume Joe's age is x. Then, his sister's age is 2x, and their father's age is 3x.

1. x + 2x + 3x = 100 ... (1)

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's age will be 3x, and his sister's age will be 2(3x) = 6x.

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father's age will be 3x - x = 2x.

Now, we can substitute the values from equation (1) into equation (3):

2x + 6x + 2x = 2x

Combine like terms:

12x + 2x = 2x

14x = 2x

x = 7

So, Joe's age is 7, his sister's age is 14, and their father's age is 21.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 50 y.

We know that x is m percent of 4y, so we can write:

x = m/100 \* 4y

x/4y = m/100

Now, we can simplify the right-hand side of the equation:

m/100 = x/4y

Since m is a percentage of x, we know that m/100 is a fraction with m as the numerator and 100 as the denominator. Therefore, we can simplify the equation further:

m/100 = x/4y = 50y

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election, so the probability of a voter not voting is 10%.

If we choose five registered voters at random, the probability that all five vote is (1 - 10%)^5 = 0.95^5 = 0.590.

The probability that exactly four of the five voters voted is therefore 1 - 0.590 = 0.410.

If the yard has an area of 240 square meters , how many meters of fencing does she need ?
Answer Choices:
A) 58
B) 62
C) 66
D) 70
E) 74
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by identifying the dimensions of the yard. Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, the yard must be a rectangle with three sides fenced. Let's call the length of the yard ""L"" and the width ""W"". Since the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we can set up the equation:

L x W = 240

Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, the length of that side is 10 meters, so we can substitute that into the equation:

L x W - 10W = 240

Now we can solve for W:

W = 240 / (L - 10)

Now we need to find the value of L. Since the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we know that L x W = 240. So we can set up the equation:

L x W = 240

Substituting W = 240 / (L - 10), we get:

L x 240 / (L - 10) = 240

Now we can solve for L:

L x 240 / L - 10 = 240

Simplifying, we get:

L x 240 = 2400

L = 12

So the length of the yard is 12 meters and the width is 20 meters (since 10 meters is the length of the unfenced side).
