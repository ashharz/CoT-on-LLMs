E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The car is being driven in a straight line, so we know that the distance traveled by the car is constant.
2. The angle of elevation changes by 15° (60° - 45°) over a time of 10 minutes.
3. We can use trigonometry to find the distance traveled by the car:

Let d be the distance traveled by the car, and h be the height of the tower.

We know that the angle of elevation is 45° at the start, so the tan(45°) = d/h.

We also know that the angle of elevation changes by 15°, so the tan(60°) = d/h + 15°.

We can set up an equation using these two equations:

d/h = tan(45°) = tan(60°) + 15°

Solving for d, we get:

d = h tan(60°) + 15°

Now we need to find out how long it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower. We know that the car is traveling at a uniform speed, so we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

We know that the distance traveled by the car is d, and the speed of the car is constant, so we can use the formula:

time = d / speed

We can substitute the value of d from the previous equation:

time = (h tan(60°) + 15°) / speed

Now we need to find the speed of the car. We can use the formula:

speed = distance / time

We know that the distance traveled by the car is d, and we can substitute the value of d from the previous equation:

speed = (h tan(60°) + 15°) / time

Now we can solve for time:

time = (h tan(60°) + 15°) / speed

The answer is:

time = (h tan(60°) + 15°) / (",A

There is no tax on the item , and this was the only item the customer bought . If the customer paid $ 1.90 more than half the original price of the item , what was the original price of the item ?
Answer Choices:
A) $ 61
B) $ 65
C) $ 67.40
D) $ 70
E) $ 78.20
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

1. The original price of the item was discounted 22%.
2. The customer bought the item at the discounted price using a $20-off coupon.
3. There is no tax on the item.
4. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item.

We can start by finding half of the original price:

Half of $61 = $61 / 2 = $30.50

Since the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, we can add $1.90 to $30.50:

$30.50 + $1.90 = $32.40

Now, we can subtract the amount of the coupon:

$32.40 - $20 = $12.40

The original price of the item was $12.40.

A) 36
B) 15
C) 17
D) 5
E) 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this step by step.

To determine if a number is divisible by 9 and 12, we can use the following rules:

* To check if a number is divisible by 9, we can look at the sum of its digits. If the sum of the digits is a multiple of 9, then the number is divisible by 9.
* To check if a number is divisible by 12, we can look at the number of times the digit 1 appears in the number. If the number contains 12 ones, then the number is divisible by 12.

Now, let's apply these rules to the given values:

A) 36:

* Sum of digits: 3 + 6 = 9, which is a multiple of 9.
* Number of 1s: 36 contains 3 ones, which is not equal to 12.

So, 36 is not divisible by both 9 and 12.

B) 15:

* Sum of digits: 1 + 5 = 6, which is not a multiple of 9.
* Number of 1s: 15 contains 1 one, which is not equal to 12.

So, 15 is not divisible by both 9 and 12.

C) 17:

* Sum of digits: 1 + 7 = 8, which is not a multiple of 9.
* Number of 1s: 17 contains 1 one, which is not equal to 12.

So, 17 is not divisible by both 9 and 12.

D) 5:

* Sum of digits: 5 contains no ones, so it is not divisible by 9.
* Number of 1s: 5 contains no 1s, so it is not divisible by 12.

So, 5 is not divisible by both 9 and 12.

E) 7:

* Sum of digits: 7 contains no ones, so it is not divisible by 9.
* Number of 1s: 7 contains no 1s, so it is not",A

C) 0.37
D) 0.46
E) 0.63
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

We know that the probability of Stock A increasing in value is 0.56, and the probability of Stock B increasing in value is 0.74. We want to find the greatest value for the probability that neither of these events will occur.

To do this, we can use the following formula:

P(neither event occurs) = 1 - P(event A occurs) - P(event B occurs)

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(neither event occurs) = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74

Simplifying, we get:

P(neither event occurs) = 1 - 1.26

P(neither event occurs) = 0.74

So the greatest value for the probability that neither of these events will occur is 0.74.

C) 280
D) 320
E) 315
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

We know that the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, which means that the selling price is 120% of the cost price. So, we can set up the equation:

Selling price = Cost price x 1.20

We also know that the selling price is Rs. 360, so we can substitute that into the equation:

360 = Cost price x 1.20

Now, we can solve for the cost price by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:

Cost price = 360 / 1.20

Cost price = 300

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 300.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 40
B) 200
C) 380
D) 400
E) 3200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. First, we know that 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag, and all of them were painted black. So, the number of white marbles in the bag before the first pull was 20 x 100 = 200.
2. After the first pull, the bag contains 200 - 20 = 180 white marbles.
3. In the second pull, 1 marble was black, so the percentage of black marbles is 1/20 = 5%.
4. Since the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 5%, we can calculate the total number of marbles in the bag as follows:

Total number of marbles = (180 x 100) / 5% = 3600

So, the answer is C) 380.",D

D) 65000
E) 97656
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To form a distinct bike number using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to choose the 2 letters and the 2 numbers independently.

Let's consider the number of possible combinations:

For the 2 letters, we have 26 choices for each letter (since we have 26 letters in the alphabet), so we have a total of 26 x 26 = 676 possible combinations for the 2 letters.

For the 2 numbers, we have 10 choices for each number (since we have 0-9 as our options), so we have a total of 10 x 10 = 100 possible combinations for the 2 numbers.

Therefore, the total number of possible combinations for a distinct bike number using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is:

676 x 100 = 67600

So, the answer is:

D) 65000

Note that we need at least 2 distinct letters and 2 distinct numbers to form a distinct bike number, so we cannot form any bike numbers with only 1 distinct letter or 1 distinct number.",D

A) 10
B) 11.5
C) 12.5
D) 13.5
E) 15
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The train starts at a speed of 100 miles/hour.
2. After covering 1/4 of the distance, the train slows down to 75 miles/hour.
3. The total distance to be covered is 100% of the distance, which is 400 miles (since the train covers 100 miles in 1 hour at 100 miles/hour).

Now, let's calculate the time taken to cover the remaining distance:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = 400 miles / 75 miles/hour

Time = 5.33 hours (rounded to the nearest hour)

Since the train covers 1/4 of the distance before slowing down, we need to add the time taken to cover this distance to the total journey duration:

Total Journey Duration = Time to cover 1/4 of the distance + Time to cover the remaining distance

Total Journey Duration = 2.5 hours (1/4 of the distance at 100 miles/hour) + 5.33 hours (remaining distance at 75 miles/hour)

Total Journey Duration = 7.83 hours (rounded to the nearest hour)

The answer is:

E) 110
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

1. At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, which means that 45% of 200 is at least 90 students (since 90 is the minimum number that can be attained if all 200 students attended the prom).
2. At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, which means that 35% of 200 is at least 70 students (since 70 is the minimum number that can be attained if all 200 students participated in the debating session).

Now, let's find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session:

Maximum number of students who attended the prom night = 90

Maximum number of students who participated in the debating session = 70

So, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:

90 - 70 = 20

The answer is:

B) 81

Explanation:

The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 20, which is the difference between the maximum number of students who attended the prom night (90) and the maximum number of students who participated in the debating session (70).",E

A) 15
B) 24
C) 25
D) 40
E) 52
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale.
2. The salesperson needs to reach a salary of at least $1000.

We can start by calculating the total amount of money the salesperson needs to make in commissions to reach a salary of $1000:

1000 = 0.1 x (some amount)

We can solve for the amount by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.1:

$1000 / 0.1 = (some amount)

$10,000 = (some amount)

Now we know that the salesperson needs to make at least $10,000 in commissions to reach a salary of $1000.

Next, we can calculate the number of sales the salesperson needs to make to reach this amount:

$10,000 / $250 (per sale) = (some number)

We can solve for the number of sales by dividing both sides of the equation by $250:

10,000 / $250 = (some number)

20 = (some number)

The answer is:

The salesperson needs to make 20 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

10,"[INST] A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month , at a production cost to the company of $ 110 per component , and sells all of the components by the end of each month . What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit ( revenue from sales minus production costs ) will be at least $ 626,400 ?
Answer Choices:
A) 226
B) 230
C) 240
D) 260
E) 280
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

First, we know that the company sells all 420 components every month, so we can calculate the total revenue for the year as follows:

Total revenue = 420 components/month x 12 months/year = 5,040 components/year

Next, we know that the production cost per component is $110, so we can calculate the total production cost for the year as follows:

Total production cost = 5,040 components/year x $110/component = $554,400

Now, we want to ensure that the yearly profit (revenue minus production cost) is at least $626,400. So, we set up the following equation:

Yearly profit = Total revenue - Total production cost

We know that the total revenue is $5,040,000 (5,040 components/year x $110/component), and the total production cost is $554,400, so we can plug these values into the equation:

Yearly profit = $5,040,000 - $554,400

Yearly profit = $4,485,600

Now, we want to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400. To do this, we can set up the following equation:

Yearly profit = Total revenue - Total production cost

We know that the total revenue is $5,040,000, and the total production cost is $554,400, so we can plug these values into the equation:

Yearly profit = $5,040,000 - $554,400

Yearly profit = $4,485,600

Now, we can solve for the minimum selling price per component by dividing the yearly profit by the number of components sold:

Minimum selling price per component = Yearly profit / Number of components sold

Minimum selling price per component = $4,485,600 / 5,",B

1. 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective.
2. 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
3. 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected.

We can start by finding the total number of staplers produced on Monday:

10% of 100% = 10% x 100% = 10% x 100 = 10

So, 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, and 90% were non-defective.

Now, we can find the number of non-defective staplers produced:

90% of 100% = 90% x 100% = 90% x 100 = 90

So, 90 non-defective staplers were produced on Monday.

Now, we can find the number of staplers rejected by mistake:

2% of 90 = 2% x 90 = 2 x 90 = 18

So, 18 non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.

Now, we can find the total number of staplers produced on Monday:

90 - 18 = 90 - 2 = 88

The answer is:

The number of staplers produced on Monday was 88.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that A and B are independent events, which means that the occurrence of one event does not affect the probability of the other event.

We also know that P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8.

To find P(A/B), we can use the formula for conditional probability:

P(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

We can write P(A ∩ B) as:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

Using the values we know, we can plug in:

P(A ∩ B) = 0.2 × 0.8 = 0.16

Now we can divide by P(B) to find P(A/B):

P(A/B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2

C) 31
D) 32
E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

So, we know that the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the first 10 months of the year is 20. To find the average for the entire 22 months, we need to find the average of 20 and the average for the remaining 12 months.

Let's call the average for the first 10 months ""x"". Then, the average for the remaining 12 months is (22 - 10) = 12.

So, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 20 x 10 = 200. And the total number of microwave ovens sold in the remaining 12 months is 12 x 12 = 144.

Now, we need to find the average of these two numbers:

(200 + 144) / 2 = (344) / 2 = 172

So, the average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire 22 months is 172.

The answer is:

C) 31

E) ( zy – x) / ( z + 2)
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

Let's start by given information:

* The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x.
* The average score for the entire class is equal to y.
* There are z students in the class, where z > 5.

We can start by finding the range of scores in the class:

Highest score: x
Lowest score: y - 2 (since the average of the highest and lowest scores is equal to x)

Now, we can find the sum of all the scores in the class:

Sum = (x + (y - 2)) + (y - 2)
= x + y - 4

Since there are z students in the class, the sum of all the scores is:

Sum = x + y - 4 + (z - 5) * (y - 2)
= x + y - 4 + zy - 10
= zy + x - 6

Now, we can find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through the problem step by step!

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7

We know that ? is a variable, so we can substitute a value for it. Let's choose a value of 3, so the expression becomes:

5 + 3 × 19 - 15 - 7

2. Next, we need to evaluate the multiplication:

3 × 19 = 57

So the expression becomes:

5 + 57 - 15 - 7

3. Now we can evaluate the addition and subtraction:

5 + 57 = 62

62 - 15 = 47

4. Finally, we need to divide the result by the value inside the parentheses:

47 / 13 × 13 = 6

The answer is:

The answer is 6.

B) 16
C) 24
D) 30
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.
2. The grocer makes $3,000 in profit.
3. To find out how many bags the grocer sold, we can set up an equation:

Profit = (Selling Price x Profit Percentage) / 100

In this case, the selling price is $100, and the profit percentage is 25%.

Profit = ($100 x 25%) / 100
Profit = $25

Now we can set up an equation to find out how many bags the grocer sold:

$3,000 = (Selling Price x Number of Bags)

We know that the grocer made $3,000 in profit, and we can see that the selling price is $100. So we can set up the equation:

$3,000 = (100 x Number of Bags)

Now we can solve for the number of bags:

$3,000 / 100 = Number of Bags

$30

The answer is:

The grocer sold 30 bags of flour.

So the correct answer is:

C) 30.",C

D) 22.35 %
E) 32.51 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this step by step!

1. First, we know that John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk. This means he replaces 15% of 50% = 0.5 x 0.15 = 0.075 of the original solution.
2. Next, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk. This means he replaces 10% of 0.5 x 0.15 = 0.075 = 0.0075 of the resultant solution.
3. So, the final solution is:

0.5 x 0.15 + 0.0075 = 0.075 + 0.0075 = 0.1525

The answer is:

C) 39.86%

Answer Choices:
A) 8880
B) 8870
C) 8890
D) 7890
E) 6780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1/16 of the students study math, so there are 16x = 1600 students studying math.
1/10 of the students study bio, so there are 10x = 1000 students studying bio.
1/8 of the students study english, so there are 8x = 800 students studying english.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we know that the sum of the number of students studying each subject must be a 4-digit number.

So, we can set up the following equation:

1600 + 1000 + 800 = 4000

Solving for x, we get:

1600 + 1000 + 800 = 4000

3400 = 4000

Now, we can find the maximum and minimum number of students by substituting the values we know into the equation:

Maximum number of students:

1600 + 1000 + 800 = 3400

Minimum number of students:

1600 + 1000 + 800 = 3400

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:

3400 - 3400 = 0

So, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 0.

The answer is:

B) 8870

Explanation:

The maximum number of students is 3400 (1600 + 1000 + 800), and the minimum number of students is also 3400 (1600 + 1000 + 800). Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is 0.",A

E) 2.85 miles
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

On a normal day, Bill averages 15 mph, so we know that:

15 mph x 21 minutes = distance traveled

Now, on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so we need to subtract 4 mph from his average speed:

15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

Now, we can calculate the distance traveled on a windy day:

11 mph x 21 minutes = distance traveled

To find the distance traveled, we can use our calculator:

11 mph x 21 minutes = 2.31 miles

So, the answer is:

B) 2.25 miles

The correct answer is 2.25 miles.",D

1. Gross profit = selling price - cost
2. We know that the gross profit is $20.00
3. Cost = selling price x (1 - gross profit percentage)
4. We know that the gross profit percentage is 40%
5. So, we can calculate the cost:

Cost = $20.00 x (1 - 0.40) = $20.00 x 0.60 = $12.00

Now we can calculate the selling price:

Selling price = cost + gross profit

Answer Choices:
A) 750
B) 700
C) 620
D) 600
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

1. First, we know that the interest rate is 6% per annum, which means the interest rate is 6% of the principal amount per year.
2. Next, we know that Rahul borrowed Rs. 500, so the principal amount is Rs. 500.
3. To find the amount that Rahul will pay after 4 years, we need to calculate the interest for each year and add it to the principal amount.
4. The formula for simple interest is:

SI = P x R x T

where SI is the simple interest, P is the principal amount, R is the interest rate, and T is the time period (in years).

So, for the first year, the interest is:

SI1 = 500 x 6/100 x 1 = 30

Now, the principal amount plus the interest for the first year is:

P + SI1 = 500 + 30 = 530

Now, let's calculate the interest for the next 3 years:

SI2 = 530 x 6/100 x 2 = 62.4

SI3 = 530 x 6/100 x 3 = 90.4

Now, the principal amount plus the interest for all 4 years is:

P + SI1 + SI2 + SI3 = 530 + 30 + 62.4 + 90.4 = 782.8

So, the amount that Rahul will pay after 4 years is Rs. 782.8.

The answer is:

C) 620

Note: The answer is not A) 750, B) 700, or D) 600, as these amounts do not correctly calculate the interest for all 4 years.",C

B) 144 km
C) 127 km
D) 228 km
E) 128 km
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's start with the information given:

* The jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey.
* The jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr during the return journey.
* The return journey takes 4 hours.

We can start by finding the distance traveled in the forward journey:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = (Speed in forward journey) x 6 hours

Since we don't know the speed in the forward journey, we can't find the distance directly. But we can find the speed in the forward journey by using the information that the return journey takes 4 hours longer than the forward journey:

Forward journey time = Return journey time - 4 hours
Forward journey time = 6 hours - 4 hours
Forward journey time = 2 hours

Now we can find the speed in the forward journey:

Speed in forward journey = Distance / Time
Speed in forward journey = (Distance / 2 hours)

Now we can substitute the distance we found earlier:

Speed in forward journey = (Distance / 2 hours)
Speed in forward journey = (126 km / 2 hours)
Speed in forward journey = 63 km/hr

Now we can find the distance traveled in the forward journey:

Distance in forward journey = Speed x Time
Distance in forward journey = 63 km/hr x 2 hours
Distance in forward journey = 126 km

Now we can find the distance traveled in the return journey:

Distance in return journey = Speed x Time
Distance in return journey = (Speed in return journey) x 4 hours

We know that the speed in the return journey is 12 km/hr higher than the speed in the forward journey:

Speed in return journey = Speed in forward journey + 12 km/hr
Speed in return journey = 63 km/hr + 12 km/hr
Speed in return journey = 75 km/hr

Now we can find the distance traveled in the return journey:

Distance in return journey = Speed x Time
Distance in return journey = 75 km/hr x 4 hours

Now we can substitute the distance we",B

A) 20 %
B) 28 %
C) 36 %
D) 40 %
E) 42 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost, so we can set up the equation:

Retail price = Wholesale cost x 1.6

2. The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so we can set up the equation:

Sale price = Retail price x 0.8

3. We know that the wholesale cost is 60% of the retail price, so we can set up the equation:

Wholesale cost = Retail price x 0.6

Now we can solve for the sale price:

Sale price = Retail price x 0.8
Sale price = (Retail price x 0.6) x 0.8
Sale price = (Retail price x 0.6) x 1.2

Now we can substitute the values we know:

Sale price = (Retail price x 0.6) x 1.2
Sale price = (Retail price x 0.6) x 1.2 x 1.6
Sale price = (Retail price x 0.6) x 2.4

Now we can solve for the sale price:

Sale price = (Retail price x 0.6) x 2.4
Sale price = Retail price x 14.4

Now we can find the sale price:

Sale price = Retail price x 14.4

The answer is:

The sale price is 42% more than the wholesale cost.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

1. We know that on the map, 1/4 inch represents an actual distance of 10 miles.
2. We also know that the length of the road from Town F to Town G is measured to be 20 inches on the map.
3. To find the actual distance between Town F and Town G, we need to multiply the length of the road on the map by the conversion factor of 1/4 inch per 10 miles.

So, we can calculate the actual distance as follows:

Actual distance = (20 inches x 1/4 inch/10 miles) x 10 miles/1 inch

Actual distance = (20 x 1/4 x 10/1) miles

Actual distance = 50 miles

A) 1584
B) 1120
C) 792
D) 1320
E) 1200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

Let's start by identifying the information we have:

* The rectangular sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set of sides.
* The rectangular sheet has a perimeter of 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.

We can start by finding the length and width of the sheet. Let's call the length ""L"" and the width ""W"".

Since the perimeter of the sheet when folded along one set of sides is 48 cm, we can set up the equation:

48 = 2(L + W)

Similarly, since the perimeter of the sheet when folded along the other set of sides is 66 cm, we can set up the equation:

66 = 2(L + W)

Now we can solve for L and W by adding the two equations together:

48 + 66 = 2(L + W)

114 = 2L + 2W

Now we can solve for L and W by subtracting 2W from both sides:

114 - 2W = 2L

L = 57

Now we can find the width W by substituting L into the first equation:

48 = 2(L + W)

48 = 2(57 + W)

48 = 114 + 2W

Subtracting 114 from both sides gives us:

34 = 2W

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

W = 17

Now we can find the area of the sheet by multiplying the length and width:

Area = LW

Area = 57 x 17

Area = 1009

The answer is C) 1009.",B

D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

The problem states that the rectangular solid is inscribed in a sphere, which means that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. We can start by looking at the dimensions of the rectangular solid:

3 x 4 x 15 = 12 x 12 x 15 = 1800

So the volume of the rectangular solid is 1800.

Now, we know that the sphere has a diameter of 15, so we can set up the equation for the volume of the sphere:

V = (1/3)πr^3

where r is the radius of the sphere.

Since the rectangular solid is inscribed in the sphere, the volume of the sphere must be equal to the volume of the rectangular solid:

1800 = (1/3)πr^3

Now, we can solve for r:

r^3 = 1800 / (1/3)π

r^3 = 600π

r = √(600π)

r = 20

So the diameter of the sphere is 20.

The answer is:

B) 15.8113

Note that this is the diameter of the sphere, not the radius.",B

A) Rs . 697.50
B) Rs . 712.50
C) Rs . 787.50
D) Rs . 750
E) Rs . 780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5% on the marked price of the watch, so the selling price is:

Marked price x (100 - Discount percentage) = Rs. 750 x (100 - 5%) = Rs. 750 x 95% = Rs. 712.50

2. The shopkeeper earns a profit of Rs. 15 less when he gives a discount of 7% instead of 5%. So, we can set up the following equation:

Profit = Selling price - Cost price

where the cost price is the marked price minus the discount:

Profit = Rs. 712.50 - Rs. 750 = Rs. -37.50

3. Since the profit is negative, the shopkeeper incurs a loss when he gives a discount of 7%. Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is B) Rs. 712.50

B) 2520
C) 1728
D) 1656
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The student found the value of 7/18 of a number, which means they divided the number by 18 with a remainder of 7.
2. The difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is 770.
3. Since the student found the value of 7/18, we know that the actual value of the number is 18 times the student's answer plus 7.

So, we can set up the equation:

18(student's answer) + 7 = actual answer + 770

Now, we can solve for the student's answer:

18(student's answer) + 7 = 18(actual answer) + 770

Subtracting 7 from both sides gives us:

18(student's answer) = 18(actual answer) - 770

Dividing both sides by 18 gives us:

student's answer = actual answer - 770/18

Now, we can substitute the given choices:

A) 1584:

18(1584) = 18(actual answer) - 770

1584 = 18(actual answer) - 770

actual answer = 18(1584) + 770

actual answer = 18(1584) + 770

B) 2520:

18(2520) = 18(actual answer) - 770

Answer Choices:
A) $ 50000
B) $ 40000
C) $ 30000
D) $ 20000
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Fixed salary: $500
2. Commission: 5% of monthly sales

So, the total monthly salary = fixed salary + commission

Now, we need to find the monthly sales that will give us a total monthly salary of $1500.

Let's assume the monthly sales are x.

Then, the total monthly salary would be:

500 + 0.05x

We want the total monthly salary to be $1500, so we can set up the equation:

500 + 0.05x = 1500

Now, we can solve for x:

0.05x = 1500 - 500

0.05x = 1000

x = 1000 / 0.05

x = 20000

So, the monthly sales that will give us a total monthly salary of $1500 are $20000.

The answer is: C) $20000.",D

B) 562
C) 458
D) 156
E) 452
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

The plane flies along the four sides of a square, so we need to find the average speed of the plane over the entire square. To do this, we need to find the total distance covered by the plane and then divide it by the time taken to cover that distance.

The four sides of the square have lengths:

Side 1: 200 km/hr x 1 hour = 200 km
Side 2: 400 km/hr x 1 hour = 400 km
Side 3: 600 km/hr x 1 hour = 600 km
Side 4: 800 km/hr x 1 hour = 800 km

Total distance = 200 km + 400 km + 600 km + 800 km = 2000 km

Time taken to cover the distance = Total distance / Speed
= 2000 km / (200 km/hr + 400 km/hr + 600 km/hr + 800 km/hr)
= 2000 km / (200 km/hr + 400 km/hr + 600 km/hr + 800 km/hr)

Now, let's simplify the expression:

2000 km / (200 km/hr + 400 km/hr + 600 km/hr + 800 km/hr)
= 2000 km / (200 km/hr x 4)
= 2000 km / 800 km
= 2.5

So, the time taken to cover the distance is 2.5 hours.

Now, we can find the average speed of the plane:

Average speed = Total distance / Time taken
= 2000 km / 2.5 hours
= 800 km/hr

The answer is C) 458 km/hr.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total.
2. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners.
3. So, the cost of each white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.
4. Let's say the cost of one brown sharpeners is x rupees.
5. Then, the cost of one white sharpeners is x + 1 rupees.
6. Since Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total, the total cost of all brown sharpeners is 18x rupees.
7. The total cost of all white sharpeners is 18(x + 1) rupees.
8. Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners, the number of white sharpeners he buys is 18 - (18x) = 18 - x.

Now, let's find the value of x:

18x + 18(x + 1) = 100

Simplifying the equation:

18x + 18x + 18 = 100

36x + 18 = 100

36x = 82

x = 82/36

x = 2

So, Jack buys 18 - 2 = 16 brown sharpeners and 18 - 2 + 1 = 19 white sharpeners.

The answer is:

B) 16 brown sharpeners and 19 white sharpeners.",A

A) 20 %
B) 30 %
C) 40 %
D) 50 %
E) 60 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

Let's start with the information we know:

* 24% of all students at Daifu University are members of both the chess club and the swim team.
* 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.

We can start by finding out how many students are members of the swim team:

24% of all students = 0.24 x total number of students

We know that 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club, so we can subtract that number from the total number of members of the swim team:

0.24 x total number of students - 0.20 x number of members of the swim team = number of members of the swim team

Now we can solve for the number of members of the swim team:

0.24 x total number of students - 0.20 x number of members of the swim team = number of members of the swim team

We can simplify this equation:

0.24 x total number of students - 0.20 x number of members of the swim team = number of members of the swim team

0.24 x total number of students - 0.20 x 0.24 x total number of students = number of members of the swim team

0.0648 x total number of students = number of members of the swim team

Now we can solve for the number of members of the swim team:

0.0648 x total number of students = number of members of the swim team

number of members of the swim team = 0.0648 x total number of students

Now we can find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:

percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team = (number of members of the swim team / total number of students) x 100

We can substitute the value we found for the number of members of the swim team:

percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team = (0.06",B

Answer Choices:
A) 81900
B) 85995
C) 85800
D) 90000
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

The population of the city is currently 78000, and it increases by 5% annually. This means that the population will increase by 5% of 78000, which is:

5% of 78000 = 0.05 x 78000 = 3900

So, the population of the city after one year will be:

78000 + 3900 = 81900

Now, we need to find the population of the city after 2 years. Since the population increases by 5% annually, we can repeat the same calculation:

The population after 2 years will be:

81900 + 3900 = 85800

So, the answer is:

C) 85800

The population of the city in 2 years time will be 85800.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 1
B) 1.25
C) 1.50
D) 1.75
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's call the speed of the first car x mph, and the speed of the second car y mph. Since they start at the same time, we know that they will meet at the midpoint of the highway.

We can set up an equation based on the distance traveled by each car:

x + y = 50 (since they both travel the same distance)

We also know that the speed of the first car is 12 mph, so we can write:

x = 12

Now we can substitute the value of x into the first equation:

12 + y = 50

Now we can solve for y:

y = 50 - 12

y = 38

Now we know that the speed of the second car is 38 mph.

To find out how long it will take for them to meet, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

Since they will meet at the midpoint of the highway, the distance between them is half of the total distance:

distance = 50 / 2

distance = 25

Now we can plug in the values we know:

time = 25 / 38

time = 0.63

The answer is:

The answer is 0.63, or approximately 63% of the way through the trip.

So, they will meet approximately 63% of the way through the trip, or about 34 miles into the trip.",E

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

1. Monthly salary:
The servant is paid a monthly salary of 1500.
2. Commission on sales:
The servant is also entitled to a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.
3. Total income desired:
The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000.

Now, let's calculate the servant's total income:

1500 (monthly salary) + (15% of monthly sale)

We know that the servant's monthly sale should be:

6000 - 1500 (monthly salary) = 4500

So, the servant's total income would be:

1500 (monthly salary) + (15% of 4500) = 1500 + 675 = 2175

The answer is:

C) 31500

C) 10 %
D) 5 %
E) 12 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

So, the man borrows Rs. 360 and he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. To find the interest rate, we need to use the formula:

Interest Rate = (Total Interest / Principal) x (1 / Number of Periods)

First, let's calculate the total interest:

Total Interest = Principal x Interest Rate x Number of Periods
= 360 x Interest Rate x 12

Now, we can solve for the interest rate:

Interest Rate = Total Interest / Principal
= 360 x 12 / 360
= 12 / 12
= 1

So, the interest rate is 1%.

The answer is:

B) 4.5 %

Note: The answer is not 1.5% because the interest rate is not 1.5%, it's 1%. The answer is not 5% because the interest rate is not 5%, it's 1%. The answer is not 10% because the interest rate is not 10%, it's 1%. The answer is 4.5% because 12 x 31.50 = 360, and 360 x 12 = 4320, so the total interest paid over 12 months is 4320 - 360 = 4060, which is equivalent to an interest rate of 4.5%.",D

C) 43.86 %
D) 44.86 %
E) 45.86 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The original price of the product was reduced by 30%, so we can find the new price by multiplying the original price by 0.7 (100% - 30%):

Original price x 0.7 = New price

2. Now, we want to find out how much the product needs to be increased to make it 100% of the original price. To do this, we can subtract the new price from the original price:

Original price - New price = Amount to increase

3. Now we can calculate the amount to increase:

Original price - New price = 100% - 30%

100% - 30% = 70%

So, the amount to increase is 70% of the original price.

4. Finally, we can find the new price by multiplying the original price by 1 + the amount to increase:

Original price x (1 + amount to increase) = New price

Original price x (1 + 0.7) = New price

Solving for the new price, we get:

Original price x (1 + 0.7) = Original price x 1.7

New price = Original price x 1.7

So, the answer is:

The answer is B) 42.86%

Explanation:

The original price was reduced by 30%, so the new price is 70% of the original price. To make the new price 100% of the original price, we need to increase it by 30%. Therefore, the new price is 42.86% above the original price.",B

Let's start by using the fact that the total amount of money in the pouch is Rs. 700.

We know that there are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins.

So, let's start by finding out how many 25 paise coins there are:

25 paise x Rs. 700 = Rs. 175

Now, we know that there are 175 25 paise coins.

Next, let's find out how many 50 paise coins there are:

50 paise x Rs. 700 = Rs. 350

Now, we know that there are 350 50 paise coins.

C) Rs . 4000
D) Rs . 3937.50
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

We know that the man spends Rs. 3500 per month and saves 12 1/2 % of his income. To find his monthly income, we can use the following formula:

Income = Spending + Savings

In this case, we know that the man spends Rs. 3500 per month, so we can set up the equation as follows:

Income = 3500 + (12 1/2 % of Income)

To find the savings, we can multiply the man's income by the savings percentage (12 1/2 %):

Savings = Income x 12 1/2 %
= Income x 0.125
= Income x 12.5

Now we can substitute the value of the savings into the original equation:

Income = 3500 + (12 1/2 % of Income)
= 3500 + (12.5 x Income)
= 3500 + 12.5 x Income

To solve for the man's monthly income, we can simply divide both sides of the equation by 12.5:

Income = (3500 + 12.5 x Income) / 12.5
= (3500 + 12.5 x Income) / 12

Now we can simplify the equation:

Income = 3500 + 12.5 x Income
= 3500 + 12.5 x (Income / 12)
= 3500 + 12.5 x (12 x Income)
= 3500 + 12.5 x 12 x Income
= 3500 + 12.5 x 12 x (Income / 12)
= 3500 + 12.5 x Income

Now we can see that the man's monthly income is:

Income = 3500 + 12.5 x Income",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

So, we have a hollow cube of size 5 cm with a thickness of 1 cm, made up of smaller cubes of size 1 cm.

First, let's find the volume of the larger cube:

Volume of larger cube = 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm = 125 cm^3

Now, we know that the smaller cubes have a volume of 1 cm^3 each, so the number of smaller cubes needed to fill the larger cube is:

Number of smaller cubes = 125 cm^3 / 1 cm^3 = 125

Now, we need to paint the outer surface of the larger cube, so we need to paint all the faces of the smaller cubes that make up the larger cube.

There are 6 faces on each smaller cube, so the total number of faces to be painted is:

Total number of faces to be painted = 125 x 6 = 750

Now, we need to find out how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted. To do this, we subtract the number of faces that have been painted (750) from the total number of faces on all the smaller cubes:

Number of faces of smaller cubes that remain unpainted = Total number of faces on all smaller cubes - Number of faces painted
= 125 x 6 = 750 - 750
= 0

So, all the faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted!

The answer is:

C) 500

All the faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted, leaving 500 faces unpainted.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

So, the frog is at the bottom of the well, which has a depth of 30 meters. If the frog jumps 3 meters up and falls back 2 meters down, that means it has a net movement of:

3 meters up + 2 meters down = 1 meter net movement

So, the frog is now 1 meter closer to the top of the well than it was before.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the frog to reach the top of the well. We can do this by dividing the total height of the well (30 meters) by the net movement of the frog (1 meter):

30 meters / 1 meter = 30 days

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 30 days.

So, it will take the frog 30 days to come out of the well.",D

D) 67
E) 44
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

Let's consider the equation:

x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + (x + 3) + (x + 4) = 10y^2

where x is the first digit of the five consecutive two-digit odd numbers.

We know that the sum of these five numbers is 10y^2, so let's expand the equation:

x + x + 1 + x + 2 + x + 3 + x + 4 = 10y^2

Combine like terms:

5x + 12 = 10y^2

Subtract 12 from both sides:

5x = 10y^2 - 12

Now, we can see that 5x is always a perfect square, so we can take the square root of both sides:

x = √(10y^2 - 12)

Now, we can see that the answer is C) 41, because:

x = √(10(41)^2 - 12) = √(410 - 12) = 41

So, the answer is 41.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by using the information that 8% of total students are interested in Football.

Total number of students = 100%

8% of total students = 8% x 100% = 80

So, there are 80 students interested in Football.

Now, we know that 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket.

Total number of students = 100%

4/5 of total students = 4 x 100% = 80

So, there are 80 students interested in Cricket.

Now, we know that 10% of total students are interested in Basketball.

Total number of students = 100%

10% of total students = 10 x 100% = 100

So, there are 100 students interested in Basketball.

Now, we know that 20 students are not interested in any games.

Total number of students = 100%

20/100% = 20

So, there are 20 students who are not interested in any games.

Now, we can add up all the students who are interested in each sport to find the total number of students in the class.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

* Q is younger than R.
* R is older than T.
* The sum of R and T's ages is 50 years.

We can start by writing an equation based on the information:

R + T = 50

Since R is older than T, we know that R is greater than T. Let's say R is x years old and T is y years old.

We can substitute the equation:

x + y = 50

Now, we know that Q is younger than R, so we can say that Q is x - 1 years old.

Substituting this into the previous equation:

x - 1 + y = 50

Simplifying:

2x - 1 = 50

Solving for x:

x = 25

Now we know that R is 25 years old and T is y years old.

We can find y by substituting x into the equation:

R + T = 50

25 + y = 50

y = 25

So, T is also 25 years old.

Now, we can find the difference between R and Q's age:

R - Q = 25 - (25 - 1) = 25 - 24 = 1

The answer is:

The answer is 1.

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is 1 year.",D

C) 17.75 miles
D) 14.75 miles
E) 10.75 miles
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

First, we know that the first quarter mile costs $3.50, so the first quarter mile will be:

3.50 x 1/4 = 0.875 miles

Now, we have $8.50 - 3.50 = $5 left for the remaining distance.

Since the next quarter mile costs 10 cents more than the previous one, the next quarter mile will cost:

10 cents x 1/4 = 0.25 miles

So, the total distance traveled so far is:

0.875 + 0.25 = 1.125 miles

Now, we have $5 left for the remaining distance. Since we have already traveled 1.125 miles, we can calculate the maximum distance we can travel as follows:

$5 / 10 cents per quarter mile = 50 quarter miles

Now, we need to convert 50 quarter miles to whole miles:

50 x 1/4 = 12.5 miles

So, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is:

1.125 + 12.5 = 13.625 miles

C) 9
D) 10
E) 11
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Sachin's current batting average is 51.
2. In the finals, he scores 78 runs.
3. To find out his new batting average after the finals, we need to calculate the average of his total runs scored in the season.
4. Total runs scored = 78 (in the finals) + x (total number of matches played)
5. New batting average = Total runs scored / Total number of matches played

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

New batting average = 78 + x / (total number of matches played)

Since Sachin's current batting average is 51, we know that his total number of matches played is not 0 (since his average is not 0). Therefore, we can start by trying different values for the total number of matches played, and see which one makes Sachin's new batting average equal to 54 (which is the average he would have after scoring 78 runs in the finals).

Let's try different values for the total number of matches played:

A) 6 matches:

New batting average = 78 + 6 / (6 matches) = 78 + 12.67 = 90.67

B) 8 matches:

New batting average = 78 + 8 / (8 matches) = 78 + 9.5 = 87.5

C) 9 matches:

New batting average = 78 + 9 / (9 matches) = 78 + 8.89 = 87.89

D) 10 matches:

New batting average = 78 + 10 / (10 matches) = 78 + 7.8 = 85.8

E) 11 matches:

New batting average = 78 + 11 / (11 matches) = 78 + 6.63 = 84.63

As we can see, the only option that makes Sachin's new batting average equal to 54 is:

C) 9 matches

Since each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters, we can start by considering the number of unique books Amy has.

Amy has 10 different types of books, so we know that the total number of books is 10.

Now, let's think about how many letters Amy needs to represent each book.

If Amy uses a single letter to represent each book, she will need 10 letters (one letter for each book).

If Amy uses a pair of letters to represent each book, she will need 5 letters (2 letters for each book).

So, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 5.

A) 60 m
B) 61 m
C) 62 m
D) 63 m
E) 64 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Since the length is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth, we can write:

l = 4w + 1

We know that the area of the rectangle is 150 square meters, so we can write:

A = lw = (4w + 1)w = 4w^2 + 1

Now we can substitute the value of A into the formula for perimeter:

P = 2(l + w) = 2(4w + 1) = 8w + 2

Now we can substitute the value of w, which is half the area:

w = 150/2 = 75

So the length is:

l = 4w + 1 = 4(75) + 1 = 300 + 1 = 301

And the perimeter is:

P = 2(l + w) = 2(301 + 75) = 8(75) + 2 = 600 + 2 = 602

Answer Choices:
A) 8.5
B) 10.5
C) 12.5
D) 14.5
E) 16.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

We know that 1 gram of the health food contains:

* 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E (0.09 x 100% = 9%)
* 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A (0.08 x 100% = 8%)

So, if we want to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to consume:

* Vitamin E: 9% of the minimum daily requirement = 0.09 x 100% = 9% of 100% = 9%
* Vitamin A: 8% of the minimum daily requirement = 0.08 x 100% = 8% of 100% = 8%

To find out how much of the health food we need to consume to meet these requirements, we can set up a system of linear equations using the information we have:

Let x be the number of grams of the health food consumed daily

Vitamin E requirement = 9% of x
Vitamin A requirement = 8% of x

We want to find out how much of the health food we need to consume to meet the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins. So, we set up the following system of equations:

Vitamin E requirement = 9% of x
Vitamin A requirement = 8% of x

Now we can solve this system of equations using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

First, we can solve the second equation for Vitamin A requirement:

Vitamin A requirement = 8% of x

Now, we can substitute this expression for Vitamin A requirement into the first equation:

Vitamin E requirement = 9% of x

Substituting the expression for Vitamin A requirement, we get:

Vitamin E requirement = 9% of x

Now we can solve for x, the number of grams of the health food consumed daily:

x = (Vitamin E requirement / 9%) / (Vitamin A requirement / 8%)

Now we can plug in the values we know:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

1. First, we know that each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
2. We also know that we need a total of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
3. To find out how many helpers we need, we need to calculate how many cakes each helper can make in total.
4. For large cakes, each helper can make 2 per hour, so they can make a total of 2 x 3 = 6 large cakes per hour.
5. For small cakes, each helper can make 35 per hour, so they can make a total of 35 x 3 = 105 small cakes per hour.
6. Now, we add up the total number of cakes each helper can make in 3 hours:

Large cakes: 6 x 3 = 18
Small cakes: 105 x 3 = 315

Total number of cakes per hour: 18 + 315 = 333

7. Since we need a total of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, we can calculate how many helpers we need:

Large cakes: 20 / 6 = 3.33 (round up to 4)
Small cakes: 700 / 105 = 6.67 (round up to 7)

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

1. First, we know that U is the midpoint of ST, so we can draw a line from R to U that passes through the midpoint of ST.
2. We also know that RS = 5 and RT = 17, so we can draw a line from R to T that passes through the point where RS and RT intersect.
3. Now, we can draw a line from T to U that passes through the midpoint of ST.

Using the properties of medians and midpoints, we know that the length of the line segment RU is equal to half the length of the line segment ST. So, we can set up the equation:

RU = (1/2)ST

We know that ST = 17 + 22 = 39, so:

RU = (1/2)ST

From the first statement, we know that two rolls have the same amount of falafel as six pita breads. So, one roll has the same amount of falafel as three pita breads.

From the second statement, we know that five baguettes have the same amount of falafel as three rolls. So, one baguette has the same amount of falafel as one and a half rolls.

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the equivalent of two baguettes in pita breads:

C) 25 %
D) 33 %
E) 18 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The shopkeeper sold items at a 20% discount for one day, so the original price of the items was:

Original price = 100% - 20% = 80%

2. To find the new price of the items after the discount, we can multiply the original price by the discount percentage:

New price = 80% x 20% = 16%

3. So, the items were sold at 84% of their original price (100% - 16%) for one day.

4. To find the percentage increase needed to return to the original price, we can divide the original price by the new price:

Percentage increase = (100% / 84%) x 100% = 33%

The answer is:

D) 33%

Explanation:
To return to the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 33% of the original price. This is because the discount of 20% reduced the price by 20% of the original price, so to return to the original price, the shopkeeper needs to increase the price by 33% of the original price (33% x 80% = 26.4% + 80% = 106.4%, which rounds to 106%).",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have a straight picket fence composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

First, let's find the total width of the fence:

Total width = x pickets x width of each picket = x x 1/2 = x/2

Now, we know that there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, so we need to subtract the space between each pair of pickets from the total width:

Total width - space between each pair of pickets = x/2 - 6

Now, we can simplify the equation:

x/2 - 6 = length of fence

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 2(length of fence) + 6

x = 2(x/2 - 6) + 6

x = 2x/2 + 12

x = 3x/2

Now, we can simplify the equation further:

3x/2 = length of fence

The answer is:

distance = speed x time

Since we know the distance, we can solve for the speed:

speed = distance / time

speed = 180 miles / time

Now, we know that the plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship, so we can set up the equation:

plane speed = 10 x ship speed

plane speed = 10 x 180 miles / time

plane speed = 1800 miles / time

Now, we know the speed of both the ship and the plane, so we can find the time it takes for them to meet. We can use the equation:

time = distance / speed

For the ship:

time = 180 miles / 180 miles/hour (ship speed)
time = 1 hour

For the plane:

time = 1800 miles / 1800 miles/hour (plane speed)
time = 1 hour

Since both the ship and the plane traveled for 1 hour, they will meet after 1 hour.

The answer is:

B) 289 miles

The ship and the plane will meet at a distance of 289 miles from the starting point.",C

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags , what is the total deer population in the forest ( assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002 ) ?
Answer Choices:
A) 300
B) 500
C) 5000
D) 6000
E) 7500
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we know that 20 deer out of 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year. This means that the proportion of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample is:

20/500 = 1/25 or 4%

Since this is a random sample of deer from the forest, we can assume that the proportion of deer with tags in the entire forest is the same as the proportion in the sample.

Now, we know that 300 deer were caught and tagged in 2001, so the total number of deer in the forest is:

300 + (4% of 300) = 300 + 12 = 312

The answer is:

C) 5000

Explanation:

We know that 300 deer were caught and tagged in 2001, and 20 deer out of 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year. By assuming that the proportion of deer with tags in the entire forest is the same as the proportion in the sample, we can calculate the total number of deer in the forest.

First, we calculate the proportion of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample:

20/500 = 1/25 or 4%

Then, we add the number of deer caught in 2001 to the proportion of deer with tags in the forest:

300 + (4% of 300) = 300 + 12 = 312

Therefore, the total number of deer in the forest is 312.",E

The main line service starts at 5 o ' clock and the harbor line starts at 5.02 A . M . A man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes . What is the probability of the man catching the first train ?
Answer Choices:
A) 0.9
B) 0.8
C) 0.6
D) 0.65
E) 1.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, so the first train on the main line will arrive at 5:00.

The harbor line starts at 5:02 AM, so the first train on the harbor line will arrive at 5:02 AM.

Since the man wants to catch the first train, he will only be able to catch the main line train if it arrives before the harbor line train.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is the probability that the main line train arrives before the harbor line train.

The probability that the main line train arrives before the harbor line train is 1 - the probability that the harbor line train arrives before the main line train.

The probability that the harbor line train arrives before the main line train is 1/2, since there is only one harbor line train and two main line trains to compare it to.

So, the probability that the main line train arrives before the harbor line train is 1 - 1/2 = 1/2.

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 1/2, or 0.5.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.
2. The population of Boomtown one year ago is given as the starting point.
3. The population of Boomtown two years from now is expected to be double the population of one year ago.

Now, let's calculate the population of Boomtown one year ago:

Population of Boomtown one year ago = 100% x (1 + 10%/year) = 100% x 2 = 200%

Now, let's calculate the population of Boomtown two years from now:

Population of Boomtown two years from now = 200% x (1 + 10%/year) x (1 + 10%/year) = 200% x 2 x 2 = 400%

As we can see, the population of Boomtown two years from now is exactly double the population of one year ago. Therefore, the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year is:

Percent population increase = (400% - 200%) / 200% = 100%

D) 50 feet
E) 60 feet
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length x Width

Since we know the width of the yard is 100 feet, and the total area is 3,000 square feet, we can set up the equation:

3,000 = 100 x Length

Now, we can solve for the length by dividing both sides of the equation by 100:

Length = 3,000 / 100

Length = 30

So, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

The answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this step by step!

1. The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11.
2. The least common multiple (LCM) of the two integers is 7700.
3. One of the integers is 350.

Now, we can start solving the problem. We know that the GCF of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. So, we can list the multiples of 11:

11, 22, 33, 44, 55, ...

Since 350 is one of the integers, we know that 11 does not divide it without leaving a remainder. Therefore, the other integer must be a multiple of 11. Let's check the multiples of 11:

11, 22, 33, 44, 55, ...

The first integer that is greater than 350 is 44, so we can choose the other integer as 44.

Answer Choices:
A) 56
B) 58
C) 60
D) 62
E) 64
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

So, we know that the original square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, which means that the length of the trimmed edge is 4 feet.

Then, we cut the trimmed piece diagonally in half to create two triangles. Since each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, we can set up the following equation:

Area of each triangle = (base x height) = 70 square feet

Since the triangles are congruent, we can use one triangle to find the height of the other. Let's call the height of one triangle ""h"".

So, the area of each triangle is:

Area = (base x height) = 70 square feet

Now, we can set up a proportion to relate the base of one triangle to the base of the other:

Base of one triangle : Base of other triangle = Height of one triangle : Height of other triangle

Since the height of one triangle is ""h"", the height of the other triangle is also ""h"".

So, we can set up the following proportion:

Base of one triangle : Base of other triangle = h : h

Now, we can simplify this proportion by canceling out the ""h"" terms:

Base of one triangle : Base of other triangle = 1 : 1

This means that the base of each triangle is the same, and we can find the base of one triangle to find the base of the other.

Let's call the base of each triangle ""b"".

So, the area of each triangle is:

Area = (base x height) = b x h

Now, we know that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so we can set up the following equation:

b x h = 70

Now, we can solve for ""b"" by dividing both sides of the equation by ""h"":

b = 70 / h

Since we know that the height of each triangle is ""h"", we can substitute ""h"" for ""h"" in the equation:

b = 70 / h

Now, we can solve for ""b"" by multiplying both sides of the equation by ""h"":

b x h = 70

Answer Choices:
A) 18
B) 30
C) 6
D) 15
E) 12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

So, the original length of the ribbon was 30 cm, and it was reduced in the ratio of 5:3. This means that for every 5 units of length that were removed from the original ribbon, 3 units were also removed.

To find the new length of the ribbon, we need to find out how many units of length were removed in total. We can do this by multiplying the ratio of 5:3 by the original length of the ribbon:

5 x 30 = 150

So, a total of 150 units of length were removed from the original ribbon. Since we removed 5 units for every 3 units, we can find the new length of the ribbon by dividing the total number of units removed by the ratio:

150 / 5 = 30

So, the new length of the ribbon is 30 cm.

Answer Choices:
A) 20
B) 30
C) 40
D) 200
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. M is a three-digit number, so it can be represented as abcd.
2. N is a three-digit number, so it can be represented as cba.
3. M > N, which means that abcd > cba.
4. M - N + 396c = 990, which can be simplified as:

abcd - cba + 396c = 990

Since M is greater than N, we can subtract N from M:

abcd - cba = M - N

Now, we can add 396c to both sides of the equation:

abcd - cba + 396c = M - N + 396c

Simplifying, we get:

abcd = M - N + 396c

Now, we need to find out how many values of M are greater than 300.

Since M is a three-digit number, the maximum value of M is 999 (999 - 396 = 603).

So, if M is greater than 300, we know that:

M > 300

And,

M - N + 396c = 990

Now, we can substitute the values of M and N:

abcd = 990

Since M is greater than 300, we know that abcd > 396c.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 40.

There are 40 values of M that are greater than 300.",A

E) none of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by using the information that 20% of the students took physics and 28% of the students took math. This means that the number of students who took physics is 20% of the total number of students, and the number of students who took math is 28% of the total number of students.

Let's say there are x students in the school.

The number of students who took physics is 20% of x, which is 0.2x.

The number of students who took math is 28% of x, which is 0.28x.

We know that the total number of students who took either physics or math is the sum of the number of students who took physics and the number of students who took math. So we can set up the equation:

0.2x + 0.28x = 100%

Simplifying the equation:

0.48x = 100%

Solving for x:

x = 100 / 0.48

1. Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years back.
2. Raj is currently 17 years old.

From point 1, we know that Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago, so we can set up a proportion:

Raj's age 5 years ago : Rahim's age 5 years ago = 1/3

Now, we know that Raj is 17 years old now, so we can set up another proportion:

Raj's age now : Rahim's age now = 17 : ?

We can substitute Raj's age now (17) into the first proportion:

17 : Rahim's age 5 years ago = 1/3

Now, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

17 x 3 = Rahim's age 5 years ago x 1/3

Rahim's age 5 years ago = 3 x 17 = 51

So, Rahim is currently 51 years old.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

First, we know that the fixed charge is Rs. 1800, as the bill for 540 calls in one month was Rs. 1800.

Next, we know that the cost per call is Rs. 1800 / 540 = Rs. 3.33 per call.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the next month's calls:

520 calls x Rs. 3.33 per call = Rs. 1716

So, the bill for the next month would be Rs. 1716 + Rs. 1800 (fixed charge) = Rs. 3516.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the third month's calls:

500 calls x Rs. 3.33 per call = Rs. 1665

1. Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes, so it makes one full rotation in 13 minutes.
2. Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes, so it makes one full rotation in 7 minutes.
3. Both balls start from the same point, so they are initially at the same position.
4. Ball A makes one full rotation in 13 minutes, while Ball B makes one full rotation in 7 minutes, so they are both moving at different speeds.
5. To find when they will be at the same starting point again, we need to find when Ball A has completed 2 full rotions and Ball B has completed 5 full rotations.
6. We know that Ball A takes 26 minutes to complete 2 full rotations, so it will take 26 x 2 = 52 minutes to complete 4 full rotations (2 full rotations + 2 full rotations).
7. Ball B takes 35 minutes to complete 5 full rotations, so it will take 35 x 5 = 175 minutes to complete 10 full rotations (5 full rotations + 5 full rotations).
8. To find when they will be at the same starting point again, we need to find when 52 minutes (for Ball A) and 175 minutes (for Ball B) are equal.
9. 52 minutes is less than 175 minutes, so we know that Ball A will complete 4 full rotations before Ball B completes 10 full rotations.

B) 30
C) 45
D) 60
E) 75
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

Let's start by identifying what we know:

* The cost of a newspaper on Sunday is $4.
* The cost of a newspaper the rest of the days of the week is $1.
* The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.
* The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.

Now, let's think about how many papers the hotel orders each day:

* On Sunday, the hotel orders 2 times the number of papers it orders on the other days of the week, so it orders 2 x (7 - 1) = 2 x 6 = 12 more papers on Sunday.
* On the other days of the week, the hotel orders 7 papers each day.

So, the total number of papers the hotel orders each week is:

12 (Sunday) + 7 (Monday) + 7 (Tuesday) + 7 (Wednesday) + 7 (Thursday) + 7 (Friday) = 70

Now, we can find out how much the hotel pays for newspapers each day:

* On Sunday, the hotel pays $4 x 12 = $48 for the additional 12 papers.
* On the other days of the week, the hotel pays $1 x 7 = $7 per day.

So, the total amount the hotel pays for newspapers each week is:

$48 (Sunday) + $7 (Monday) + $7 (Tuesday) + $7 (Wednesday) + $7 (Thursday) + $7 (Friday) = $210

Now, we can find out how many papers the hotel buys on Monday:

The hotel orders 7 papers on Monday, since that is the number of papers it orders each day except Sunday.

D) 24
E) 25
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's say there were x people who attended the picnic. Since 4 of them didn't show up, that means there were x - 4 people who attended.

We know that the total amount spent on eatables was Rs. 96, so the cost per person would be:

Rs. 96 / (x - 4) = Rs. 96 / x

Now, we know that the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each, so the total amount each person had to contribute is:

Rs. 96 / x + Rs. 4

We want to find out the value of x, so we can substitute the expression Rs. 96 / x + Rs. 4 into the equation:

Rs. 96 / x + Rs. 4 = Rs. 96 / x + Rs. 4

Simplifying, we get:

Rs. 96 / x = Rs. 92 / x

Now, we can see that Rs. 92 is the amount each person had to contribute if 4 people didn't show up.

So, the answer is:

The answer is x = 8

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

The given rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. To form a square, we need to find a way to make the length of the rectangle equal to the breadth.

First, let's find the perimeter of the rectangle:

Perimeter = 2(length + breadth)
= 2(27 + 17)
= 2(44)
= 88 cm

Now, we can see that the perimeter of the rectangle is 88 cm, which is greater than the length of the rectangle. This means that we can rebend the rectangle to form a square by reducing the length of the rectangle by the amount that the perimeter exceeds the length.

Let's subtract the length of the rectangle from the perimeter to find the amount by which we need to reduce the length:

88 - 27 = 61

So, we need to reduce the length of the rectangle by 61 cm to form a square.

Now, let's find the new length of the rectangle:

New length = original length - amount to reduce
= 27 - 61
= 11 cm

Since the breadth of the rectangle remains the same, the new length and breadth of the square will be equal:

New length = new breadth
= 11 = 11

The answer is:

The answer is 11 cm.",C

So, Silu says that she weighs 51 kg. Meenu replies that she won't reveal her weight directly because she is overweight, but she gives us a clue that she weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight.

Let's start by finding out what half of Meenu's weight is. Half of 29 kg is:

29 kg / 2 = 14.5 kg

Now, we know that Meenu weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight, which is:

29 kg + 14.5 kg = 43.5 kg

C) 90 Min
D) 120 Min
E) 60 Min
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

So, Roy was given 5 tablets and was asked to take one tablet every 15 minutes. This means he will take the first tablet after 15 minutes, then the second tablet after another 15 minutes, and so on.

Here's a table to help us visualize the timing:

| Time | Tablet |
| --- | --- |
| 0 minutes | 1 |
| 15 minutes | 2 |
| 30 minutes | 3 |
| 45 minutes | 4 |
| 60 minutes | 5 |

Now, let's calculate the time it will take Roy to consume all 5 tablets:

1. He will take the first tablet at time 0 minutes, so that takes 0 minutes.
2. He will take the second tablet at time 15 minutes, so that takes 15 minutes.
3. He will take the third tablet at time 30 minutes, so that takes 30 minutes.
4. He will take the fourth tablet at time 45 minutes, so that takes 45 minutes.
5. He will take the fifth and final tablet at time 60 minutes, so that takes 60 minutes.

Adding up all these times gives us a total of:

0 + 15 + 30 + 45 + 60 = 150 minutes

So, it will take Roy 150 minutes (or 2.5 hours) to consume all 5 tablets.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's say the youngest member is 7 years old, so the age of the next member would be 7 + 3 = 10.

The next member's age would be 10 + 3 = 13, and so on.

Since the sum of all the members' ages is 250, we can set up an equation:

7 + 10 + 13 + ... + (250 - 7) = 250

We can simplify this equation by noticing that the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series is given by:

n(n + 1)/2

where n is the number of terms.

So, we can substitute n = 250 - 7 = 243:

243(243 + 1)/2 = 250

Solving for n, we get:

n = 243

Therefore, the number of members in the club is 243.

D) 3 D / ( M 2 - 3 M)
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's say the original cost of the gift is D.

If 3 men drop out, the remaining men will have to contribute more towards the purchase of the gift.

So, the new cost of the gift for the remaining men will be:

New Cost = (M - 3) x D

Since there are now fewer men contributing to the purchase, the new cost per person will be higher than the original cost.

So, the amount each remaining man will have to contribute will be:

Contribution = New Cost / (M - 3)

Now, we need to find out what the new cost and the number of remaining men are.

We know that 3 men dropped out, so the number of remaining men is:

M - 3

And we know that the original cost of the gift was D, so the new cost for the remaining men will be:

New Cost = D x (M - 3)

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

New Cost = D x (M - 3)

Substituting M = 5 and D = Rs. 1000, we get:

New Cost = 1000 x (5 - 3)

New Cost = 1000 x 2

New Cost = 2000

So, the new cost of the gift for the remaining 2 men is Rs. 2000.

Now, we can find out how much each remaining man will have to contribute:

Contribution = New Cost / (M - 3)

Contribution = 2000 / 2

Contribution = 1000

So, each remaining man will have to contribute Rs. 1000 towards the purchase of the gift.

D) 2 pm on the next day
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Let's first calculate the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow:

Distance = Speed x Time

For Train A:

Distance = 40 kmph x 4 hours (to cover the distance from Mumbai Central to Lucknow)

Distance = 160 km

For Train B:

Distance = 72 kmph x 2 hours (to cover the distance from Mumbai Central to Lucknow)

Distance = 144 km

Now, we need to find the time at which the two trains meet. We can do this by finding the point where the two trains are at the same distance from Mumbai Central.

Let's assume that Train A is at a distance x km from Mumbai Central at 2 pm, and Train B is at a distance y km from Mumbai Central at the same time.

Since both trains are running on the same route, they will meet when they are at the same distance from Mumbai Central.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + y = 160 (for Train A)
x + y = 144 (for Train B)

Now, we can solve this system of equations. We know that x + y = 160 for Train A, and x + y = 144 for Train B.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 120 km

Now, we can find y:

y = 160 - x

y = 160 - 120

y = 40

So, Train A is 120 km from Mumbai Central at 2 pm, and Train B is 40 km from Mumbai Central at the same time.

The two trains will meet at 40 km from Mumbai Central, which is at 5 pm.

The answer is:

C) 5 pm on the day.

Therefore, the two trains will meet at 5 pm on the same day.",A

So, Mark told John that if he gives him half of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that Mark's money is twice as much as John's money.

Now, John said that if he gives Mark one-third of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that John's money is three times as much as Mark's money.

So, we can set up the equation:

Mark's money = 2John's money

And we know that Mark's money is twice as much as John's money, so we can write:

Mark's money = 2John's money = 2(3x) = 6x

Now, we know that Mark has Rs. 75, so we can set up the equation:

6x = 75

Solving for x, we get:

x = 75/6 = 12

So, John has Rs. 12.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

So, we know that the number of water lilies on the lake doubles every two days, and it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies if there is only one water lily on the lake.

Initially, there are 64 water lilies on the lake, so we can start by doubling that number:

64 x 2 = 128

So, after two days, there will be 128 water lilies on the lake.

Now, let's double that number again:

128 x 2 = 256

So, after four days, there will be 256 water lilies on the lake.

Now, let's double that number again:

256 x 2 = 512

So, after six days, there will be 512 water lilies on the lake.

Since it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, we can see that the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 60 - 6 = 54 days.

Given:

* x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days
* y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days

We want to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days.

First, let's analyze the information given:

* x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days

This means that the rate at which the x men work is x units per day.

* y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days

This means that the rate at which the y men work is y units per day.

Now, we need to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days. To do this, we need to find the total amount of work that can be completed by the y men in y days.

Let's use the formula for work:

Work = Rate x Time

In this case, the rate is the number of units per day, and the time is the number of days.

So, to find the total amount of work that can be completed by the y men in y days, we need to multiply the rate (y units per day) by the time (y days):

Work = y x y = y^2

Now, we need to compare this to the work that can be completed by x men working x hours per day in x days. We know that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, so we can set up a ratio:

x units of work / x men working x hours per day = x^2

We want to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days, so we need to find the ratio of y men working y hours per day to x men working x hours per day:

y units of work / y men working y hours per day = y^2 / x^2

Now, we can equate these two ratios:

y^2 / x^2 = x^2

Solving for y, we get:

y = x^2

D) 15
E) 20
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's go step by step!

1. We know that ABCDE is a regular pentagon, so all the sides are equal. Let's call the length of each side ""s"".
2. Since F is the center of the pentagon, the distance between F and any of the vertices of the pentagon is equal to the length of the side.
3. To form a quadrilateral, we need to choose four of the vertices of the pentagon. We can choose any four vertices we like, as long as they do not include the center point F.
4. There are 5 vertices in total (A, B, C, D, and E), so there are 5 x 4 = 20 possible combinations of four vertices.
5. However, not all of these combinations form valid quadrilaterals. For example, if we choose A, B, C, and E, the quadrilateral would not be a valid shape because it would not be a closed shape (it would have two open sides).
6. To count the number of valid quadrilaterals, we need to exclude the combinations that do not form closed shapes. There are 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120 possible combinations of four vertices.
7. However, some of these combinations are identical (e.g. ABCD and ABDC are the same quadrilateral). To account for this, we need to divide the total number of combinations by the number of identical combinations. In this case, there are 10 identical combinations ( ABCD, ABDC, ACDB, ACDB, BACD, BADC, BCAD, BCDB, CABD, CADB), so the total number of valid quadrilaterals is 120 / 10 = 12.

We know that minor arc AC is 160°, so the sum of minor arc AC and minor arc BD is:

160° + minor arc BD = 180°

Since B bisects minor arc AC, we know that:

minor arc BD = 160° - 80° = 80°

Now, we can find the measure of minor arc AD by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a semicircle is 180°:

minor arc AD + minor arc BD = 180°

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

minor arc AD + 80° = 180°

B) 28
C) 21
D) 80
E) 23
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

The area of the cross-section is given as 640 square meters, so we can start by finding the height of the trapezium.

The formula for the area of a trapezium is:

Area = (height x base) / 2

Since the height is perpendicular to the base, we can find the height by dividing the area by the base.

640 = (height x 6) / 2

Now, we can solve for height:

height = 2 x 640 / 6

height = 2 x 106 / 6

height = 2 x 17.67

height = 35.34

So, the height of the trapezium is 35.34 meters.

Now, we can find the depth of the canal by subtracting the height from the width at the top:

depth = 10 - 35.34

depth = -25.34

The answer is:

The depth of the canal is 25.34 meters.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

1. First, we need to find the circumference of the fan blade. Since the fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan, the radius of the fan blade is half of that, or 5 centimeters.

Circumference = 2πr, where r is the radius of the fan blade

Circumference = 2π(5) = 31.4159 (approximately)

2. Next, we need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds. Since the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, we know that the fan blade rotates once every 300 seconds.

Distance = Circumference x Revolutions

Distance = 31.4159 x 300

Distance = 9424.7 (approximately)

C) 25 < x < 64
D) 28 < x < 60
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have the equation:

x = (n^2 + 2√n(n+4) + 16)/(n+4√n+4)

First, let's simplify the expression:

x = (n^2 + 2n + 16)/(n+4)

Now, we can see that n is a positive integer, so we can rewrite the expression as:

x = (n^2 + 2n + 16)/(n+4)

Now, let's consider the range of n:

36 ≤ n ≤ 72

So, we can substitute the lower and upper bounds of n into the expression:

x = (36^2 + 2(36) + 16)/(36+4)
= (1296 + 72 + 16)/40
= 25

x = (72^2 + 2(72) + 16)/(72+4)
= (576 + 144 + 16)/76
= 28

So, we can see that x is equal to 25 when n is 36, and x is equal to 28 when n is 72.

The answer is:

B) 23 < x < 58

Since 25 is less than 58, and 28 is greater than 58.",D
115,"[INST] At its maximum speed , a space shuttle can travel 700 m high in 40 seconds . It will also take 5 seconds to pass a point . What then is the length of the space shuttle ?
Answer Choices:
A) 50 m
B) 75 m
C) 100 m
D) 125 m
E) 150 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem:

1. The space shuttle can travel 700 m high in 40 seconds.
2. It will take 5 seconds to pass a point.

Let's start by converting the time it takes to pass a point from seconds to meters:

5 seconds x 3600 seconds/hour = 18,000 meters/hour

Now, we can use the formula for distance traveled to find the length of the space shuttle:

Distance = Speed x Time

In this case, the speed is the speed at which the space shuttle is traveling, and the time is the time it takes to pass a point.

Speed = Distance / Time

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Speed = 700 m / 5 s = 140 m/s

Now we can use the formula for distance traveled to find the length of the space shuttle:

Distance = Speed x Time

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Distance = 140 m/s x 40 s = 5600 m

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is:

The answer is: C) 100 m

Explanation:

The distance traveled by the space shuttle is 5600 m, which is the product of the speed (140 m/s) and the time (40 s). Since the speed is given in meters per second, we can convert the distance traveled to meters by multiplying by the number of seconds:

5600 m x 3600 s/hour = 18,000 m/hour

Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 100 m, which is the closest answer choice to 18,000 m/hour.",C

A) 2 months
B) 4 months
C) 23 months
D) 24 months
E) 84 months
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the information given:

1. A starts the business with Rs. 40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs. 60,000.
3. C joins after some more time (we don't know how much time).
4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs. 375,000.
5. C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. A starts the business with Rs. 40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs. 60,000.
So, the total amount now is:

40,000 + 60,000 = 100,000

3. C joins after some more time.
Let's assume C joins after x months.

Now, the total amount at the end of x months is:

100,000 + (x \* profit per month)

where profit per month is the profit made by the business per month.

4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs. 375,000.
So, the total amount at the end of the year is:

100,000 + (x \* 12 \* profit per month)

where 12 is the number of months in a year.

5. C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share.
So, the amount that C gets is:

150,000 / (x \* 12 \* profit per month)

Now, we can set up an equation:

150,000 / (x \* 12 \* profit per month) = 375,000

Now, we can solve for x:

x \* 12 \* profit per month = 375,000 / 150,000

x \* 12 \* profit per month = 250,0",B

C) 8.75
D) 8.71
E) 8.72
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

So, we have a square paper with a side length of 20 cm, and two semi-circles are drawn on opposite sides as diameters. If these semi-circles are cut out, what's left is the remaining paper.

First, let's find the radius of each semi-circle. Since they are diameters, the radius is half the diameter, which is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.

Now, we can find the area of each semi-circle using the formula:

Area = πr^2

where r is the radius.

For the first semi-circle, the area is:

Area = π(10)^2 = π(100) = 100π

For the second semi-circle, the area is:

Area = π(10)^2 = π(100) = 100π

Now, we add the areas of the two semi-circles to find the total area of the remaining paper:

Total Area = 100π + 100π = 200π

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 8.75

To see why, let's convert the area from pi to decimal form:

200π = 200 x 3.14 = 628

So, the area of the remaining paper is 628 square centimeters.",C

C) M + N / 4
D) M + 3 N / 8
E) M + N / 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's break down the problem step by step!

First, we know that the athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so their running speed is:

M / 4 = miles per hour

Next, we know that the athlete rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so their biking speed is:

N / 4 = miles per hour

Now, we need to find the average speed for both activities combined. We can do this by adding the two speeds together:

(M / 4) + (N / 4) = miles per hour

Simplifying, we get:

(M + N) / 8 = miles per hour

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) M + N / 4.

Therefore, the average speed for both activities combined is the sum of the running and biking speeds, divided by 4.",A

E) 97 men
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's start with the information given:

* 8 men can complete a work in 6 days.

Now, we want to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in half a day.

To do this, we can use the concept of ""halving the time."" Since we want to complete the work in half a day, we can halve the time given in the problem:

6 days / 2 = 3 days

So, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the work in 3 days.

We can use the same number of men to complete the work in 3 days as we used to complete the work in 6 days.

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 95 men.

Explanation:

We know that 8 men can complete the work in 6 days, so we can assume that 1 man can complete the work in 6 days / 8 = 3/8 of the work.

Therefore, to complete the same work in half a day (3 days), we need 3/8 of the number of men who can complete the work in 6 days:

3/8 x 8 = 95 men

So, we need 95 men to complete the same work in half a day.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

1. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so we know that:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 70 x 3 (hours)
Distance = 210 miles

2. Once he reached B, he turned right around and returned to A, so we know that:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 90 x 3 (hours)
Distance = 270 miles

3. We are told that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B, and he was only 70 miles away from it. This means that:

Time = 3 hours before the end of the trip
Time = 3 x 60 (minutes) = 180 minutes

4. We can now use the formula for distance traveled to find the distance between A and B:

Distance = Speed x Time

E) 25
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's work through this problem step by step:

1. We know that 30 is subtracted from a number, and the result is reduced to its one-third.
2. To find the original number, we can set up an equation:

Original number - 30 = one-third of original number

3. We know that one-third of the original number is 22.5, so we can substitute this into the equation:

Original number - 30 = 22.5

4. Now we can solve for the original number:

Original number = 22.5 + 30

Original number = 52.5

5. Finally, we can find 50% of the original number by multiplying by 0.5:

50% of original number = 0.5 x 52.5

50% of original number = 26.25

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

Let's start with the given information:

1. The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17.
2. The sum of the squares of its digits is 109.
3. If we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order.

Now, let's think step by step:

Step 1: Find the number by summing the digits.

The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, so we can write the number as:

a + b + c = 17

where a, b, and c are the digits.

Step 2: Find the sum of the squares of the digits.

The sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so we can write:

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

Step 3: Subtract 495 from the number.

If we subtract 495 from the number, we get:

a + b + c - 495

Now, let's substitute the values of a, b, and c from step 1 and step 2:

a + b + c - 495
= 17 + 17 + 17 - 495
= 17 + 17 + 17 + 495
= 109 + 495

Step 4: Simplify the expression.

The expression 109 + 495 simplifies to:

109 + 495 = 504

So, the number we are looking for is:

C) 70 %
D) 86 %
E) 90 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

First, we know that the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth. To find out their weight on Venus, we need to use the formula:

weight on Venus = weight on Earth x (gravity on Venus / gravity on Earth)

We know that the gravity on Venus is about 90% of the gravity on Earth, so we can substitute that value in:

weight on Venus = 211 pounds x (90% / 100%)

weight on Venus = 211 pounds x 0.9

weight on Venus = 189.9 pounds

So, the astronaut would weigh approximately 189.9 pounds on Venus. To find the percentage of their weight on Earth, we can divide their weight on Venus by their weight on Earth:

(189.9 pounds / 211 pounds) x 100%

(189.9 pounds / 211 pounds) x 100% = 89.6%

E) 81 km / h
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

We know that the man walks at 5 kmph for 6 hours, so we can calculate his distance traveled as:

Distance = Speed x Time = 5 km/hr x 6 hrs = 30 km

Now, we know that the man walks at 4 kmph for 12 hours, so we can calculate his distance traveled as:

Distance = Speed x Time = 4 km/hr x 12 hrs = 48 km

Now, we need to find the total distance traveled by the man. We can add the distances traveled at both speeds:

Total Distance = 30 km + 48 km = 78 km

Now, we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time taken:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The organization needs to raise Rs. 6 lakh.
2. Each employee needs to contribute Rs. 60 extra.
3. The total contribution with all employees contributing Rs. 60 extra is Rs. 6.24 lakh.

Now, we can set up a equation to represent the situation:

Total Contribution = Number of Employees x Contribution per Employee

We know that the total contribution is Rs. 6.24 lakh, and the contribution per employee is Rs. 60. So, we can solve for the number of employees:

Number of Employees = Total Contribution / Contribution per Employee
= Rs. 6.24 lakh / Rs. 60
= 104

Therefore, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this step by step!

1. First, we know that 20% of the voters are not eligible to vote, so we need to subtract that from the total number of voters:

5000 - (20% of 5000) = 5000 - 1000 = 4000

2. Now, we know that the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, so we need to find 15% of the remaining eligible voters:

4000 x 15% = 600

3. Now, we add the number of votes the winning candidate received to the number of eligible voters:

4000 + 600 = 4600

Answer Choices:
A) 4
B) 3
C) 2
D) 1
E) 0
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The diver got $3.40 after one dive.
2. She got 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.
3. Let's assume she found x copper coins and y brass coins.
4. The total amount she got from copper coins is 20x.
5. The total amount she got from brass coins is 25y.
6. The total amount she got from all coins is 3.40 = 20x + 25y.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information:

20x + 25y = 340

Now, we can solve for x:

20x = 340 - 25y

x = 340 - 25y / 20

Now, we can substitute the value of y:

x = 340 - 25(10) / 20

x = 340 - 250 / 20

x = 340 - 12.5

x = 327.5

So, the diver found 327 copper coins.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1. Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time.
2. They travel towards each other along the same route at constant speeds of 20 m/s and 40 m/s, respectively.
3. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds.

We can start by finding the distance traveled by Ram in 10 seconds:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 20 m/s x 10 s
Distance = 200 m

Now, we know that Ram meets Krishna at point C, so the distance between A and C is the sum of the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna:

Distance between A and C = Distance traveled by Ram + Distance traveled by Krishna
Distance between A and C = 200 m + (40 m/s x Time)

Since Krishna travels for 10 seconds more than Ram, we can find the time taken by Krishna as follows:

Time taken by Krishna = Time taken by Ram + 10 s
Time taken by Krishna = 10 s

Now, we can find the distance traveled by Krishna:

Distance traveled by Krishna = Speed x Time
Distance traveled by Krishna = 40 m/s x 10 s
Distance traveled by Krishna = 400 m

Therefore, the distance between A and C is:

Distance between A and C = 200 m + 400 m
Distance between A and C = 600 m

B) 41 km / hr
C) 43 kms / hr
D) 45 kms / hr
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Let's start by converting the distances and times to the same unit of measurement, such as hours.

Car X covers a distance of 320 kms in 8 hours, so its speed is:

Speed of Car X = Distance / Time
= 320 km / 8 h
= 40 km/hr

Car Y covers a distance of 415 kms in 5 hours, so its speed is:

Speed of Car Y = Distance / Time
= 415 km / 5 h
= 83 km/hr

Now, we need to find the difference in the speed of the two cars. To do this, we can subtract the speed of Car Y from the speed of Car X:

Difference in speed = Speed of Car X - Speed of Car Y
= 40 km/hr - 83 km/hr
= -43 km/hr

So, the difference in the speed of the two cars is -43 km/hr.

The answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's break this down step by step!

1. Winson runs from his home to school at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, so he covers:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 10 miles/hr x 1 hour
Distance = 10 miles

2. Then, he walks back home along the same route at an average speed of 5 miles/hr, so he covers:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 5 miles/hr x 1 hour
Distance = 5 miles

Total distance = Distance from school to home + Distance from home to school
Total distance = 10 miles + 5 miles
Total distance = 15 miles

The answer is:

C) 4

Explanation:
The total distance from Winson's home to school and back is 15 miles. Since he runs at an average speed of 10 miles/hr, it takes him 1 hour to reach school, and since he walks at an average speed of 5 miles/hr, it takes him 2 hours to walk back home. Therefore, the distance from his home to his school is 4 miles (15 miles / 2 hours).",E

If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls , and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls , how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day ?
Answer Choices:
A) 80
B) 120
C) 240
D) 320
E) 360
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by using the information that the store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, which means it sold 80% of 600 golf balls, which is:

80% of 600 = 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold. So, we can set up the following equation:

Number of yellow golf balls sold = Number of white golf balls sold

We also know that the store started with 600 golf balls, so we can set up the following equation:

600 - Number of golf balls sold = Number of golf balls remaining

Now we can substitute the equation for the number of white golf balls sold into the equation for the number of golf balls remaining:

600 - (Number of white golf balls sold) = Number of golf balls remaining

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold:

600 - (Number of yellow golf balls sold) = Number of golf balls remaining

Now we can solve for the number of yellow golf balls sold:

600 - Number of yellow golf balls sold = Number of golf balls remaining

We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so we can set up the following equation:

0.8 x 600 = Number of golf balls sold

Solving for the number of golf balls sold, we get:

0.8 x 600 = 480

Now we can substitute this value into the equation for the number of yellow golf balls sold:

600 - Number of yellow golf balls sold = Number of golf balls remaining

Substituting 480 for the number of golf balls sold, we get:

600 - Number of yellow golf balls sold = 480

Solving for the number of yellow golf balls sold, we get:

Number of yellow golf balls sold = 600 - 480

Number of yellow golf balls sold = 120

C) 13.5 metre
D) 14 metre
E) 15 metre
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

Given:

* The flagstaff is 17.5 meters high and casts a shadow of length 40.25 meters.

We can start by using the fact that the length of the shadow is proportional to the height of the object casting the shadow. So, if the flagstaff is 17.5 meters high, the shadow it casts will be a certain percentage of that height.

Let's assume that the shadow is x% of the height of the flagstaff. We can use this information to set up an equation:

x = (40.25 meters) / (17.5 meters) = 0.235 (or 23.5%)

Now, we know that the height of the building will also cast a shadow, and we can use the same percentage to find the height of the building.

Let's assume that the height of the building is y meters. We can set up an equation:

y = (28.75 meters) / (17.5 meters) = 0.165 (or 16.5%)

Now, we can use the fact that the shadow of the building will be a certain percentage of its height to find the height of the building.

The answer is:

C) 13.5 meters

Explanation:

We know that the shadow of the flagstaff is 23.5% of its height, so the height of the flagstaff is 17.5 x 100 / 23.5 = 13.5 meters.

Similarly, we know that the shadow of the building is 16.5% of its height, so the height of the building is 17.5 x 100 / 16.5 = 13.5 meters.

Therefore, the answer is C) 13.5 meters.",B

B) 5 hours
C) 6 hours
D) 4 hours
E) 7 hours
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break this down step by step:

1. Both cars start at the same point and time, so they have the same distance traveled at any given time.
2. The first car travels at 55 mph, so it covers a distance of 55 miles in 1 hour.
3. The second car travels at 52 mph, so it covers a distance of 52 miles in 1 hour.
4. Since both cars start at the same point and time, they are initially the same distance apart.
5. As time passes, the first car travels 55 miles in 1 hour, while the second car travels 52 miles in 1 hour.
6. After 1 hour, the first car has traveled 55 miles and the second car has traveled 52 miles, so they are now 3 miles apart (55 - 52 = 3).
7. Since they are traveling in the same direction, they continue to move away from each other at the same rate.
8. After 2 hours, the first car has traveled 110 miles (55 + 55 = 110), and the second car has traveled 104 miles (52 + 52 = 104).
9. Now, the first car is 6 miles ahead of the second car (110 - 104 = 6).
10. After 3 hours, the first car has traveled 165 miles (55 + 55 + 55 = 165), and the second car has traveled 157 miles (52 + 52 + 52 = 157).
11. Now, the first car is 18 miles ahead of the second car (165 - 157 = 18).

Answer Choices:
A) 0.5
B) 0.6
C) 0.7
D) 0.8
E) 0.9
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that the events A and B are independent, so the probability that at least one of them occurs is just the product of their individual probabilities:

P(at least one occurs) = P(A occurs) + P(B occurs)

We're also given that P(A occurs) = 0.6 and P(B occurs) = 1 - P(A occurs), since B occurs if and only if A does not. So:

P(B occurs) = 1 - 0.6 = 0.4

Now we can find the probability that B occurs using the formula for the probability of an event occurring:

P(B occurs) = P(at least one occurs) - P(A occurs)

Substituting the values we have, we get:

P(B occurs) = 0.96 - 0.6

P(B occurs) = 0.36

So the probability that event B occurs is 0.36, or 36%.

The answer is:

C) 0.36",E

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

So, we have a cube with a volume of $V = l^3$, where $l$ is the length of the side of the cube.

The sphere that fits inside the cube has a radius $r$, and its volume is given by $V = (4/3)πr^3$.

Now, we need to find the ratio of the volume of the cube to the volume of the sphere. To do this, we can set up a ratio of the two volumes:

$$\frac{V}{V'} = \frac{l^3}{4/3πr^3}$$

Simplifying this ratio, we get:

$$\frac{V}{V'} = \frac{l^3}{4/3πr^3} = \frac{l^3}{πr^3}$$

Now, we can see that the ratio of the volumes of the cube to the sphere is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the sides of the cube to the radius of the sphere:

$$\frac{V}{V'} = \frac{l}{r}$$

So, the answer is:

The answer is $D) 6 : π$.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

First, we know that the merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, so we can calculate the cost per kg as follows:

Cost per kg = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5 per kg

Next, we know that the merchant sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg, so we can calculate the total revenue as follows:

Total revenue = Rs. 7.50 per kg x 90 kg = Rs. 675

Now, we can calculate the percentage gain as follows:

C) 1 hr 8 min
D) 56 min
E) 55 min
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

First, we know that Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, so the distance between City A and City B is 9 am - 5 am = 4 hours.

Next, we know that Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, so the distance between City B and City A is 10:30 am - 7 am = 3 hours and 30 minutes.

Now, we need to find the time at which the two trains cross each other. We know that Train M travels at a speed of 50 km/h, and Train N travels at a speed of 60 km/h.

Let's use the formula d = speed x time to find the time it takes for each train to travel the distance between the cities:

For Train M:
d = 50 km/h x 4 hours = 200 km

For Train N:
d = 60 km/h x 3 hours and 30 minutes = 180 km

Now, we can find the time it takes for each train to travel the distance by dividing the distance by the speed:

For Train M:
time = distance / speed = 200 km / 50 km/h = 4 hours

For Train N:
time = distance / speed = 180 km / 60 km/h = 3 hours

Now that we have the times it takes for each train to travel the distance, we can find the time at which they cross each other by adding the times it takes for each train to travel the distance:

Time for Train M to travel = 4 hours
Time for Train N to travel = 3 hours

Time at which the two trains cross each other = Time for Train M to travel + Time for Train N to travel = 4 hours + 3 hours = 7 hours

The answer is:

So, we know that the shorter ant is 6 inches tall, and the shadow of the taller ant is 10 inches long. We can start by finding the height of the taller ant.

The height of the taller ant = shadow of the taller ant / height of the shorter ant
= 10 inches / 6 inches
= 1.67 (or approximately 1.7)

So, the taller ant is approximately 1.7 times as tall as the shorter ant.

Now, we can use this ratio to find the height of the shadow that the taller ant casts.

The height of the shadow = height of the taller ant x height of the shorter ant
= 1.7 x 6 inches

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by using the formula for the semi-perimeter of a rectangle:

semi-perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width of the rectangle.

We know that the height of the room is 2 times the width of the paper, so the width of the paper is half the height of the room:

w = h/2

where h is the height of the room.

We also know that the area of the walls is 15 sq m, so the area of the paper is:

A = w x h

Substituting w = h/2, we get:

A = (h/2) x h

Simplifying, we get:

A = h^2/4

Now we can use the information that the cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter:

C = A x Rs/m

Substituting A = h^2/4, we get:

C = (h^2/4) x Rs/m

Simplifying, we get:

C = h^2/2

Now we can set up an equation using the information that the cost is Rs. 260:

h^2/2 = 260

Solving for h, we get:

h = sqrt(260)

h = 14

So the height of the room is 14 meters.

C) 82
D) 92
E) 102
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

The sum of k consecutive integers is 51, and the least integer is -50. So we can set up the equation:

-50 + 1 + 2 + ... + k = 51

We know that the sum of the first k positive integers is equal to the sum of the first k consecutive integers, so we can rewrite the equation as:

1 + 2 + ... + k = 51

Now, we can simplify the equation by recognizing that the sum of the first k positive integers is equal to k(k+1)/2.

So, we have:

k(k+1)/2 = 51

Now, we can solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

k = 51/2

k = 25

So, the answer is:

The answer is 25.

Therefore, the least integer is -50, and the sum of k consecutive integers is 51.",E
156,"[INST] In a survey of students , each student selected from a list of 10 songs the 2 songs that the student liked best . If each song was selected 5 times , how many students were surveyed ?
Answer Choices:
A) 96
B) 48
C) 32
D) 25
E) 18
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

Let's say there are 10 songs in the list, and each student selects 2 songs they like best. This means each student has 2 choices.

If each song is selected 5 times, then the total number of selections for each song is 2 x 5 = 10.

So, the total number of students who selected each song is 10.

Now, we need to find out how many students were surveyed. We can do this by dividing the total number of selections for each song by the number of selections per student.

Let's divide 10 by 2 (the number of selections per student):

10 ÷ 2 = 5

So, there were 5 students surveyed.

E) Can not be determined
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

Given the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0, we know that if one of the roots is 1.5, then we can write:

1.5 = x + m/2

Now, we can substitute this expression for x into the original equation:

1.5 = (1.5 + m/2)^2 + m/2 + 22

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

1.5 = (3 + m/2)^2 + m/2 + 22

Simplifying, we get:

1.5 = 3^2 + m/2 + 22

Expanding, we get:

1.5 = 9 + m/2 + 22

Subtracting 22 from both sides gives us:

1.5 = 9 + m/2

Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:

m/2 = 6

Now, we can find the value of m by multiplying both sides by 2:

m = 2(6) = 12

So, the value of m is 12.

C) 10 ! / 2
D) 10 ! / 4
E) 10 ! / 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

First, we need to determine the number of ways the meeting can be held if the PM speaks before the MP and the MP speaks before the MLA.

Since the PM speaks before the MP, there are 9 speakers after the PM (the MP and the 8 MLAs). So, the number of ways the meeting can be held is:

9 ! = 9 × 8 = 72

Now, we need to subtract the number of ways the meeting can be held if the MP speaks before the MLA, since we already counted those in the previous step.

There are 8 speakers after the MP (the 8 MLAs), so the number of ways the meeting can be held if the MP speaks before the MLA is:

8 ! = 8 × 7 = 56

Now, we subtract the number of ways the meeting can be held if the MP speaks before the MLA from the total number of ways the meeting can be held:

72 - 56 = 16

So, the answer is:

The answer is 16.

There are 16 ways the meeting can be held if the PM speaks before the MP and the MP speaks before the MLA.",B

E) 50 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay, so the weight of sand in the mixture is:

30% of 10 kg = 3 kg

2. The weight of clay in the mixture is:

70% of 10 kg = 7 kg

3. To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove the excess clay and replace it with pure sand.

Let x kg of clay be removed and replaced with pure sand.

4. Since the total weight of the mixture is 10 kg, the weight of the mixture after removing x kg of clay will be:

10 kg - x kg

5. The weight of sand in the mixture after removing x kg of clay will be:

3 kg + (10 kg - x kg) \* 70%

= 3 kg + (10 kg - x kg) \* 0.7

= 3 kg + 7 kg \* 0.7

E) 65.5 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

So, the man spends 70% of his income, which means he saves 30% of his income.

If his income increases by 20%, then his new income is:

Old income x 1.20 = New income

So, his new income would be:

$100 x 1.20 = $120

Now, we can calculate his new expenditure:

New expenditure = Old expenditure x (1 + Percentage increase)

New expenditure = $70 x (1 + 0.20)

New expenditure = $70 x 1.20

New expenditure = $84

So, the answer is:

B) 7
C) 10
D) 14
E) 21
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's start by considering the number of ways we can choose the 98 red tulips. We can choose the first red tulip in $98$ ways, the second in $97$ ways, and so on, so the total number of ways to choose the 98 red tulips is:

$$98 \cdot 97 \cdot 96 \cdot \cdots \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 98!$$

Now, for each of these ways of choosing the 98 red tulips, we can choose the 28 white tulips in $28$ ways, since there are $28$ white tulips to choose from. So, the total number of ways to choose the 98 red and 28 white tulips is:

$$98! \cdot 28 = 98! \cdot 28 = 98 \cdot 28 \cdot 97 \cdot 96 \cdot \cdots \cdot 2 \cdot 1$$

Now, we need to find the number of bouquets that can be made such that no flowers are left out. Since each bouquet must contain both 98 red tulips and 28 white tulips, we need to ensure that we use all 126 tulips.

Let's count the number of bouquets that can be made by considering the number of red tulips first:

* If we use 98 red tulips, we can choose the 28 white tulips in $28$ ways, so there are $98 \cdot 28 = 2764$ bouquets that can be made.
* If we use 97 red tulips, we can choose the 28 white tulips in $28$ ways, so there are $97 \cdot 28 = 2664$ bouquets that can be made.
* If we use 96 red tulips, we can choose the 28 white tulips in $28$ ways, so there are $96 \cdot 28 = 2564$ bouquets that can be made.

D) – x < y
E) x < – y
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. x < 0: This means that x is negative.
2. y > 0: This means that y is positive.
3. |x^3| > |y^2|: This means that the absolute value of x cubed is greater than the absolute value of y squared.

Now, let's consider the possible values of x and y:

x < 0: x can take any negative value.
y > 0: y can take any positive value.

Now, let's analyze the possible combinations of x and y:

1. x = -1, y = 1: In this case, |x^3| = 1 > |y^2| = 1, so the statement is true.
2. x = -2, y = 2: In this case, |x^3| = 8 > |y^2| = 4, so the statement is true.
3. x = -3, y = 3: In this case, |x^3| = 27 > |y^2| = 9, so the statement is true.

Since all the possible combinations of x and y satisfy the statement, we can conclude that:

E) 48 km
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's break down the problem step by step!

1. Allen starts from X and goes to Y, so we can say that Allen's distance traveled = 54 kmph x time taken = 54 km/h x time = ?
2. Bob starts from Y and goes towards X, so we can say that Bob's distance traveled = 78 kmph x time taken = 78 km/h x time = ?
3. When Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X, so we can say that Allen's total distance traveled = 54 km + (54 km x time taken to return to X) = 54 km + (54 km x time)
4. When Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y, so we can say that Bob's total distance traveled = 78 km + (78 km x time taken to return to Y) = 78 km + (78 km x time)
5. We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, so we can set up the equation:

Bob's total distance traveled - Allen's total distance traveled = 48 km

6. We can substitute the values we have found for Bob's and Allen's total distance traveled:

78 km + (78 km x time) - 54 km + (54 km x time) = 48 km

7. Now we can solve for time:

78 km + (78 km x time) - 54 km + (54 km x time) = 48 km

8. We can simplify the equation:

2 x time = 48 km - 54 km

9. We can solve for time:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the new tires over four years:

4 years x $180 per tire = $720

Next, we need to calculate the cost of repairing the current tires over one year:

1 year x $40 per tire = $40

Now, we can calculate the total cost of the new tires over four years compared to the cost of repairing the current tires over four years:

$720 (new tires) - $40 (repair cost) = $680

To find the percentage difference, we can divide the difference in cost by the cost of the new tires:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's say the length of the shorter piece of rope is x meters. Then the length of the longer piece of rope would be x + 3 meters.

We know that the total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 3) = 20

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 3 = 20

Subtracting 3 from both sides gives us:

2x = 17

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

x = 8.5

C) $ 216
D) $ 202
E) $ 200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

1. First, we need to calculate the interest for the first six months:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Interest = $5,000 x 12% x 1/2

Interest = $600

2. Next, we need to calculate the interest for the second six months:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Interest = $5,000 x 12% x 1/2

Interest = $600

3. Now, we add the interest for both six-month periods:

Total Interest = Interest1 + Interest2

Total Interest = $600 + $600

Total Interest = $1,200

4. Finally, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount at maturity:

Total = Principal + Interest

Total = $5,000 + $1,200

Total = $6,200

First, we can see that the first column has the numbers 1, 2, and 3, so we know that the multiplication table is for a 3x3 matrix.

Next, we can see that the second column has the numbers 4, 5, and 6, so we know that the second row is the multiplier for the first column.

Now, let's look at the third column. We can see that it has the numbers 7, 8, and 9, so we know that the third row is the multiplier for the second column.

Finally, we can see that the fourth column has the numbers 0, 0, and 0, so we know that the fourth row is the multiplier for the third column.

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

The perimeter of a rectangular plot is given as 340 meters, and we need to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter wide boundary around the plot.

First, let's find the length of the plot. We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to the sum of the lengths of all its sides. So, we can write:

Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Since the perimeter is given as 340 meters, we can set up the equation:

340 = 2(length + width)

Solving for the length, we get:

Length = 340 / 2

Length = 170 meters

Now that we have the length, we can find the width:

Width = Perimeter - Length

Width = 340 - 170

Width = 170 meters

Now that we have the width and length, we can find the area of the plot:

Area = Length x Width

Area = 170 x 170

Area = 30,600 square meters

Finally, we can find the cost of gardening the boundary by multiplying the area by the cost per square meter:

Cost = Area x Cost per square meter

Cost = 30,600 x 10

Cost = 306,000

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

1. 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels.
2. The remaining 66% of revenue was from the sale of biographies.

We can start by finding the total revenue of Ace Book Company:

Total revenue = 34% of revenue (from novels) + 66% of revenue (from biographies)

Total revenue = 0.34 x revenue (from novels) + 0.66 x revenue (from biographies)

Now, we can substitute the values given:

Total revenue = 0.34 x revenue (from novels) + 0.66 x revenue (from biographies)

Total revenue = 0.34 x revenue (from novels) + 0.66 x biography revenue

We know that the revenue from novels is 34% of the total revenue, so we can set up a proportion:

0.34 x revenue (from novels) + 0.66 x biography revenue = Total revenue

Now, we can solve for the unknown value, which is the revenue from biographies:

0.66 x biography revenue = Total revenue - 0.34 x revenue (from novels)

We can substitute the values given:

0.66 x biography revenue = Total revenue - 0.34 x revenue (from novels)

0.66 x biography revenue = Total revenue - 0.34 x $x (from novels)

Where $x is the revenue from novels.

Now, we can solve for the revenue from biographies:

0.66 x biography revenue = Total revenue - 0.34 x $x (from novels)

0.66 x biography revenue = Total revenue - 0.34 x revenue (from novels)

We know that the revenue from novels is 34% of the total revenue, so we can set up a proportion:

First, we have:

a2 - b2 / (a + b)2 = (a - b)2

We can start by simplifying the numerator:

a2 - b2 = (a - b)(a + b)

Now we can see that the numerator is the product of (a - b) and (a + b), so we can factor it out:

(a - b)(a + b) = a2 - b2

Now we can see that the denominator is (a + b)2, so we can simplify it:

a2 - b2 / (a + b)2 = a2 - b2 / (a + b)(a + b)

Now we can see that the numerator and denominator have the same factor of (a + b), so we can cancel it out:

a2 - b2 / (a + b)2 = a2 - b2 / (a + b)(a + b) = a2 - b2

So the final answer is:

This means that the number is both greater than 36 and less than 86.

We can start by finding the difference between 36 and 86:

86 - 36 = 50

Now, we can find the difference between the number and 36:

Number - 36 = 50

Since the number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86, we can set up an equation:

50 = (Number - 36) = (Number - 86)

D) 21 min
E) 20 min
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's say that A can construct the wall in 40 minutes, so the wall's length is 40/A = 40/60 = 2/3 of the wall's length.

Now, let's say that B can construct the wall in 45 minutes, so the wall's length is 45/B = 45/80 = 3/4 of the wall's length.

Since both A and B are working together, the total time it takes to construct the wall is the sum of their individual times:

C) 20 seconds
D) 33 seconds
E) 55 seconds
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

First, we know that the train takes exactly 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, so we can start by finding out how far the train travels during those 3 seconds.

We know that the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, so we can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

In this case, the distance the train travels during the 3 seconds it takes to enter the tunnel is:

distance = 120 miles/hour x 3 seconds = 360 miles

Now, we know that the tunnel is 1 mile long, so we can find out how long it takes the train to pass through the tunnel by subtracting the distance it travels during the 3 seconds it takes to enter the tunnel from the total distance the train travels:

time to pass through tunnel = total distance - distance traveled during entry

time to pass through tunnel = 360 miles - 1 mile = 359 miles

Finally, we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

to find out how long it takes the train to pass through the tunnel:

time to pass through tunnel = 359 miles / 120 miles/hour = 3 minutes

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 20 seconds.

A) 247.67
B) 237.67
C) 227.67
D) 215.67
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

The invoice for the motor boat has terms of 4/30, n/100, which means that the buyer has 30 days to pay the invoice and if they pay within 10 days, they receive a 2% discount.

To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount, we need to calculate the amount of interest they would pay if they waited the full 30 days to pay the invoice.

First, let's calculate the amount of the invoice:

$20,000 x 2% = $400

So the total amount of the invoice is $20,000 + $400 = $20,400.

Now, let's calculate the simple interest rate:

Simple interest rate = (Total amount / Principal) - 1

In this case, the principal is the amount of the invoice, which is $20,000. The total amount is $20,400, so we can calculate the simple interest rate as follows:

Simple interest rate = ($20,400 - $20,000) / $20,000

Simple interest rate = $400 / $20,000

Simple interest rate = 2%

So the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to take advantage of the discount is 2%.

The answer is B) 237.67.

To calculate this, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Simple interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is $20,000, the rate is 2%, and the time is 30 days.

Simple interest = $20,000 x 2% x 30

Simple interest = $20,000 x 0.02 x 30

Simple interest = $20,000 x 600

Simple interest = $12,000

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

First, we need to find out how many ways we can divide the 10 lime soda bottles among the two groups. We can do this by using the formula for combinations:

n! = (n + 1) × (n + 2) × ... × (n + k)

where n is the number of items we have (in this case, 10), and k is the number of groups we want to divide the items into (in this case, 2).

So, we have:

10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × ... × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800

Now, we need to subtract out the number of ways we can divide the bottles into one group of 5 and one group of 5, since we've already counted those in our previous calculation:

3,628,800 - 5! × 5! = 3,628,800 - 120 × 120 = 3,628,800 - 14,400 = 3,614,400

C) 7
D) 6
E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's start by identifying the ratio of rice, wheat, and corn in the special cereal mixture:

Rice: Wheat: Corn = 2:3:5

Now, we know that the bag of cereal contains 3 pounds of rice. So, we can set up a proportion to find out how much corn is in the bag:

3 pounds of rice = 2/2 x 3 pounds of wheat + 3/3 x 5 pounds of corn

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

3 pounds of rice = 2 pounds of wheat + 15 pounds of corn

Now, we can solve for the amount of corn in the bag:

15 pounds of corn = 2 pounds of wheat + 3 pounds of rice

Subtracting 2 pounds of wheat from both sides gives us:

13 pounds of corn = 3 pounds of rice + 2 pounds of wheat

Now, we can find the answer:

The answer is C) 7 pounds of corn.

So, the bag of cereal contains 3 pounds of rice, 2 pounds of wheat, and 7 pounds of corn.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

First, let's analyze the given information:

* One soda costs 150 cents.
* Two sodas cost 300 cents.
* One energy bar costs 150 cents.
* Three energy bars cost 450 cents.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars.

If we buy two sodas and three energy bars, we know that the total cost is 300 cents + 450 cents = 750 cents.

So, if we buy six sodas, we know that the cost will be 6 x 150 cents = 900 cents.

And if we buy seven energy bars, we know that the cost will be 7 x 150 cents = 1050 cents.

Now, let's think about the total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars. We know that the cost of six sodas is 900 cents, and the cost of seven energy bars is 1050 cents.

So, the total cost of six sodas and seven energy bars will be:

C) Rs . 5.6
D) Rs . 8
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

First, we know that the company produces 7200 pens, and each pen is priced at Rs. 10. So, the total revenue of the company is:

7200 pens x Rs. 10 per pen = Rs. 72,000

Next, we know that the company has an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. This means that the profit on 7200 pens is:

25% of Rs. 72,000 = Rs. 18,000

Now, we also know that 10% of the produced pens are always defective and are rejected before packing. This means that the number of defective pens is:

10% of 7200 pens = 720 pens

So, the total number of pens that the company needs to produce is:

7200 pens - 720 defective pens = 6480 pens

Now, we can calculate the manufactured cost of each pen:

Total revenue - Total cost = Profit

72,000 - Cost = 18,000

Cost = 72,000 - 18,000

Cost = Rs. 54,000

Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is:

Rs. 54,000 / 6480 pens = Rs. 8.4

E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, let's define the notation used in the problem:

[x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x

So, for example, [3] = 3, and [4.5] = 4.

Now, let's look at the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y):

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y]

R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

Now, let's consider the possible values of x and y. Since we're looking for positive real numbers, we know that x and y must be positive.

Let's assume that x = 2 and y = 1. Then, we have:

L(x,y) = [2] + [1] + [2+1] = 3 + 1 + 3 = 7

R(x,y) = [2*2] + [2*1] = 4 + 2 = 6

194,"[INST] Three bells ring at intervals of 36 seconds , 40 seconds and 48 seconds , respectively . They start ringing together at a particular time . When they will ring together again ?
Answer Choices:
A) After 6 minutes
B) After 12 minutes
C) After 18 minutes
D) After 24 minutes
E) none
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. The first bell rings every 36 seconds.
2. The second bell rings every 40 seconds.
3. The third bell rings every 48 seconds.

We know that they start ringing together at a particular time, so we can let the time of the first ring be t = 0.

Now, we can find the next time when all three bells will ring together:

1. The first bell will ring again after 36 seconds, so the next time it rings is t + 36 = 0 + 36 = 36 seconds.
2. The second bell will ring again after 40 seconds, so the next time it rings is t + 40 = 36 + 40 = 76 seconds.
3. The third bell will ring again after 48 seconds, so the next time it rings is t + 48 = 76 + 48 = 124 seconds.

Since all three bells ring at the same time, we can see that they will ring together again when the sum of their intervals is equal to the time since the last ring:

36 + 40 + 48 = 124

Therefore, the next time all three bells will ring together is:

124 seconds after the first bell rings, which is:

124 x 3 = 372 seconds

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) After 18 minutes.",B

C) 20
D) 23
E) 24
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

Given:

* The electric pole is 14 meters high
* The shadow of the electric pole is 10 meters long

We know that the shadow of the electric pole is proportional to the height of the object casting the shadow. So, if the electric pole is 14 meters high, the tree must be at least 14 meters - 10 meters = 4 meters taller than the electric pole to cast a shadow of 15 meters.

Therefore, the height of the tree is:

The answer is: C) 20 meters

Explanation: The tree must be 4 meters taller than the electric pole to cast a shadow of 15 meters, so the height of the tree is 14 + 4 = 20 meters.",A
196,"[INST] At my favorite fruit stand , an orange costs 18 dollars , a pineapple costs 27 dollars , and a grape costs 15 dollars . Using the same logic , can you tell how much a mango costs ?
Answer Choices:
A) 22 dollars
B) 15 dollars
C) 20 dollars
D) 18 dollars
E) 10 dollars
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's analyze the information given:

* An orange costs 18 dollars.
* A pineapple costs 27 dollars.
* A grape costs 15 dollars.

We can start by noticing that the prices of the fruits are not in any specific order, so we can't simply assume that the next fruit will cost the same as the previous one. However, we can look for patterns in the prices.

One pattern we can see is that the prices of the fruits increase as the fruit gets more expensive. For example, oranges are the cheapest, followed by grapes, and then pineapples are the most expensive.

Using this pattern, we can make an educated guess about the price of a mango. Since mangoes are typically more expensive than grapes, we can expect the price of a mango to be higher than 15 dollars (the price of grapes).

Let's try to estimate the price of a mango based on the pattern we've observed:

* Oranges cost 18 dollars.
* Grapes cost 15 dollars.
* Pineapples cost 27 dollars.

We can see that the price of each fruit increases by a certain amount as we move from left to right in the list. Specifically, the price increases by 3 dollars (18 - 15 = 3) for each fruit.

Using this pattern, we can estimate the price of a mango as follows:

* Oranges cost 18 dollars.
* Grapes cost 15 dollars.
* Pineapples cost 27 dollars.

To find the price of a mango, we can add the increase of 3 dollars to the price of the previous fruit:

18 (oranges) + 3 = 21
15 (grapes) + 3 = 18
27 (pineapples) + 3 = 30

Therefore, we can estimate that a mango costs 30 dollars.

The answer is: C) 30 dollars.",B
197,"[INST] In the coordinate plane , a triangle has vertices at ( a , 0 ) , ( b , 0 ) , and ( x , y ) . If a > x > b > 0 > y , which of the following represents the area of that triangle ?
Answer Choices:
A) ( ay − by) / 2
B) ( ab − ay) / 2
C) ( by − ay) / 2
D) ( ay + by) / x
E) ( a − b) / 2 y
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

First, let's label the vertices of the triangle as A (at (a, 0)), B (at (b, 0)), and C (at (x, y)).

Next, we can find the area of the triangle by using the formula:

Area = (base × height) / 2

Since the height of the triangle is y, and the base is the segment from A to C, we can find the base by using the distance formula:

base = sqrt((x - a)^2 + (y - 0)^2)

Now we can plug in the values we know:

base = sqrt((x - a)^2 + (y - 0)^2)
= sqrt((x - a)^2 + y^2)
= sqrt(x^2 + y^2)

Now we can find the area:

Area = (base × height) / 2
= (sqrt(x^2 + y^2) × y) / 2
= (x y) / 2

Now we need to simplify the expression:

The answer is:

A) (ay - by) / 2

The correct answer is A.

Answer Choices:
A) 80 kmph
B) 50 kmph
C) 120 kmph
D) 70 kmph
E) 80 kmph
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The car covers a distance of x km in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/h.
2. The car has to cover the same distance in 10 hours, so the time taken is 10 hours.
3. To find the speed at which the car has to travel to cover the distance in 10 hours, we can use the formula:

Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the distance is the same as in part 1 (x km), and the time is 10 hours.

So, we can substitute the values and solve for the speed:

Speed = x / 10

Simplifying, we get:

Speed = 60 km/h x 10

Speed = 600 km/h

The answer is:

The car has to travel at a speed of 600 km/h to cover the same distance in 10 hours.

E) 13 / 45
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Alan randomly guesses the answer, so the probability of him guessing correctly is 1/5.
2. Roger cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, so the probability of him answering correctly is 2/3.
3. Peter performs the calculations and marks the answer, so the probability of him answering correctly is 5/6.

Now, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to find the probability that only Peter answers correctly, and neither Alan nor Roger cheated.

The probability that Alan guesses correctly is 1/5, and the probability that Roger cheats and answers correctly is 2/3. So, the probability that neither Alan nor Roger answers correctly is:

1 - (1/5 + 2/3) = 1 - (1/5 + 2/9) = 1 - 7/9 = 2/9

Now, we need to find the probability that Peter answers correctly. Since he performs the calculations and marks the answer, the probability of him answering correctly is 5/6.

So, the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:

2/9 x 5/6 = 10/9

200,"[INST] The difference between simple interest and C . I . at the same rate for Rs . 5000 for 2 years in Rs . 72 . The rate of interest is ?
Answer Choices:
A) 10 %
B) 12 %
C) 6 %
D) 8 %
E) 4 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

We know that the principal amount is Rs. 5000, and the interest is to be calculated for 2 years.

For simple interest, we can use the formula:

SI = P x R x T

where SI is the simple interest, P is the principal amount, R is the rate of interest, and T is the time period.

Since the problem states that the interest is to be calculated for 2 years, T = 2.

We know that the interest is Rs. 72, so we can set up the equation:

SI = 5000 x R x 2

Now, we need to find the rate of interest. We can do this by dividing the interest by the principal amount and the time period:

R = SI / (P x T)

Substituting the values we have, we get:

R = 72 / (5000 x 2)

Simplifying, we get:

R = 72 / 10000

R = 0.072

So, the rate of interest is 7.2%.

3. 50% of the files are not infected by a virus.

From point 3, we know that 50% of 250 is 125 files.

Now, let's find the number of files infected by a worm:

2.5 x 250 = 625 (files infected by a worm)

Now, we can find the number of files not infected by a worm:

250 - 625 = 125 (files not infected by a worm)

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's work this out step by step!

Let's say Mohan's share is x.

We know that Sohan's share is 5100 - x.

We also know that if their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they will receive equal amounts on attaining the age of 26 years.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + (4/100)x = 5100 + (4/100)(5100 - x)

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4x = 5100 + 4(5100 - x)

16x + 4x = 5100 + 20400 - 4x

20x = 25500

Dividing both sides by 20:

x = 1275

So, Mohan's share is 1275.

1. First, we need to calculate 30% of 1400 grams:

1400 x 0.30 = 420 grams

So, 30% of 1400 grams is 420 grams.

2. Next, we need to calculate 60% of 420 grams:

D) w / ( 3 xy)
E) 3 y / ( wx)
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

First, we know that the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. This means that the rate of the liquid flowing through the drain is:

w gallons/25 gallons/x seconds = x gallons/seconds

Now, we need to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. To do this, we can use the formula:

time = amount / rate

In this case, the amount is y gallons, and the rate is x gallons/seconds. So, we can set up the equation:

time = y / x

Now, we need to solve for time. We know that x is equal to 25, so we can substitute that into the equation:

time = y / 25

Now, we can simplify the equation:

time = y / 25

The answer is:

The answer is y/25.

So, it will take y/25 minutes for y gallons to pass through the drain.",C

Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. The coin made of alloy is 2 mm thick and has a diameter of 15 mm, so its volume is:

Volume = π x (15 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 30π mm^3

2. The weight of the coin is 30 grams, so the weight of the alloy is:

Weight = 30 grams

3. The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver, so the weight of the alloy is also the weight of the silver:

Weight of silver = Weight of alloy / (weight of aluminum in the alloy)
= 30 grams / (weight of aluminum in the alloy)

4. Since the weight of the aluminum in the alloy is 2/3 of the weight of the coin, we can find the weight of the aluminum as follows:

Weight of aluminum = Weight of coin x (weight of aluminum in the alloy) / (weight of coin)
= 30 grams x (2/3) / 30 grams
= 2/3 x 30 grams
= 20 grams

5. Now, we can find the weight of the pure aluminum coin by multiplying the weight of the aluminum in the alloy by the ratio of the weight of silver to the weight of aluminum:

Weight of pure aluminum = Weight of aluminum in the alloy x (weight of silver / weight of aluminum)
= 20 grams x (2 x 30 grams / 20 grams)
= 20 grams x 6
= 120 grams

The answer is:

D) 210
E) 220
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that 2/3 of a number is equal to 40.
2. If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number, we need to find out what 2/3 of the number is first.
3. To find 2/3 of a number, we can multiply the number by 2/3.
4. So, 2/3 of the number is (number) x 2/3 = (number) x 2/3.
5. Now, we subtract 10 from 2/3 of the number:

(number) x 2/3 - 10

6. To solve for the number, we can set up an equation:

(number) x 2/3 - 10 = 40 + 1/3(number)

7. Simplify the equation:

(number) x 2/3 - 10 = 40 + (number)/3

8. Solve for the number:

(number) = 40 + (number)/3

9. The answer is:

The answer is C) 150.

Explanation:

We know that 2/3 of a number is equal to 40, so we can set up an equation:

(number) x 2/3 = 40

Multiplying both sides by 2/3 gives us:

(number) = 40 x 2/3

Simplifying, we get:

(number) = 40 x 2/3 = 80

Now, we subtract 10 from 2/3 of the number:

80 - 10 = 70

So, the answer is 70. However, we know that 2/3 of the number is equal to 40, so we can set up an equation:

70 = 40 + (number)/3

Solving for the number, we get:

(number) = 70 - 40

(number) = 30

Therefore, the answer is C) 150.",C

B) 7
C) 3
D) 8
E) 12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's step through this problem together.

The quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 can be factored as:

x^2 - 5x + k = (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0

From this factorization, we can see that the equation has two real and distinct roots if and only if the discriminant of the factorization, which is given by the formula:

Δ = b^2 - 4ac

is positive. In this case, we have:

Δ = (5)^2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k

Since we want the equation to have two real and distinct roots, we need Δ to be positive, so we set Δ = 0 and solve for k:

25 - 4k = 0

Solving for k, we get:

k = 12

So, the largest integral value of k for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots is 12.

1. Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour.
2. The dog ate exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session.
3. The dog began to eat at noon.

We know that the dog ate 3 times:

* At 8:00 am (starting time)
* At 9:00 am (1 hour later)
* At 10:00 am (1 hour later)

So, the dog ate 1/3 of the food at each feeding session, so the amount of food left in the bowl after each feeding is:

* 8:00 am: 2/3 of the original amount
* 9:00 am: 1/3 of the original amount
* 10:00 am: 1/3 of the original amount

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this step by step!

1. We know that 60% of the people who took the survey were women.
2. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.
3. We know that 10 men liked green cars more than red cars.

Now, let's use this information to find out how many people took the survey.

Let x be the total number of people who took the survey.

Since 60% of the people who took the survey were women, the number of women who took the survey is 0.6x.

Since 75% of the men who were surveyed preferred red cars over green cars, the number of men who preferred red cars is 0.75x.

We know that 10 men liked green cars more than red cars, so the number of men who preferred green cars is 10.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information we have:

0.6x + 0.75x + 10 = x

Combine like terms:

0.6x + 0.75x + 10 = 1.45x

Subtract 0.75x from both sides:

0.6x + 10 = 1.45x - 0.75x

214,"[INST] IF one gallon of soft drink is made of 40 % orange juice and 60 % water , how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed in order to make the orange juice 60 % of the soft drink ?
Answer Choices:
A) 0.5
B) 1
C) 1.25
D) 1.5
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

So, we know that one gallon of the soft drink is made up of 40% orange juice and 60% water. This means that:

40% of one gallon = 0.4 x 1 = 0.4 gallons of orange juice
60% of one gallon = 0.6 x 1 = 0.6 gallons of water

Now, we want to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink. To do this, we need to add more orange juice to the mixture.

Let's say we add x gallons of orange juice to the mixture. Then, the new composition of the soft drink would be:

40% of one gallon + x gallons of orange juice = 0.4 + x gallons of orange juice
60% of one gallon + x gallons of orange juice = 0.6 + x gallons of water

We want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink, so we set up the equation:

0.4 + x gallons of orange juice = 0.6 + x gallons of water

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting 0.4 from both sides of the equation:

x gallons of orange juice = 0.6 - 0.4 = 0.2 gallons of water

So, we need to add 0.2 gallons of orange juice to the mixture to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

The answer is:

C) 1.25 gallons of orange juice.",A

C) 3 / 5
D) 4 / 5
E) 6 / 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's go through the problem step by step!

There are 5 horses in the race, and Mr. Jain selects two of them at random. We can represent the selection of the horses as a sample space, where each horse is one outcome:

S = {(H1, H2), (H1, H3), (H1, H4), (H1, H5), (H2, H3), (H2, H4), (H2, H5), (H3, H4), (H3, H5), (H4, H5)}

Since there are 5 horses, each horse has a probability of being selected as one of the two chosen horses. Let's assign a probability of 1/5 to each horse being selected.

P(H1) = P(H2) = P(H3) = P(H4) = P(H5) = 1/5

Now, we need to find the probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse. Let's define the event that the first horse selected (H1) wins the race:

A = {(H1, H2), (H1, H3), (H1, H4), (H1, H5)}

The probability of the event A is:

P(A) = 4/5 \* 1/5 = 4/25

Since Mr. Jain selected two horses, the probability that he selected the winning horse is the probability that one of the selected horses is the winning horse:

P(winning horse) = P(A ∩ {H1, H2}) = P(A) \* P(H1)

Substituting the values, we get:

P(winning horse) = 4/25 \* 1/5 = 1/10

The answer is:

The probability that Mr. Jain selected the winning horse is 1/10.

So, the answer is (D) 4/10.",B

D) 13
E) 14
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. We know that 2272 and 875 are both divisible by 3, so we can write:

2272 = 3k + 2
875 = 3j + 5

where k and j are integers.

2. We also know that the remainder when 2272 and 875 are divided by a 3-digit number N is the same, so we can write:

2272 - N = 875 - N + 2

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

3k + 2 - N = 3j + 5 - N + 2

Simplifying, we get:

3k - N = 3j + 3

3. Now, we can see that the sum of the digits of N is:

N = 3k + 3j

Since k and j are integers, the sum of their digits is:

N = 10 + 11 = 21

218,"[INST] On a test the passing students had an average of 83 , while the failing students had an average
of 55 . If the overall class average was 76 , what percent of the class passed ?
Answer Choices:
A) 44 %
B) 66 %
C) 68 %
D) 72 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we know that the overall class average is 76.

We also know that the passing students had an average of 83, so we can find the percentage of passing students by subtracting the class average from the passing students' average and dividing by the class average:

(83 - 76) / 76 = (7) / 76 = 0.094 (or 9.4%)

Now, we know that 9.4% of the class passed.

To find the percentage of students who failed, we can subtract the percentage of passing students from 100:

100 - 9.4% = 100 - 94 = 5.6%

So, 5.6% of the class failed.

The answer is:

B) 66%

Here's the calculation:

Passing students: 83 x 9.4% = 782.2 (or 782 with 2 decimal places)

Failing students: 76 - 782.2 = 557.8 (or 558 with 2 decimal places)

Total students: 782.2 + 557.8 = 1340

Therefore, the percentage of students who passed is 9.4% and the percentage of students who failed is 5.6%.",E

A) $ 83
B) $ 92
C) $ 90
D) $ 97
E) $ 104
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. The average wage for a fortnight (15 days) is $90 per day.
2. The average wage for the first 7 days was $87 per day.
3. The average wage for the last 7 days was $92 per day.

We can calculate the total wage for the first 7 days:

7 days x $87 per day = $606

And the total wage for the last 7 days:

7 days x $92 per day = $654

Total wage for the fortnight:

$606 + $654 = $1260

Now, we can calculate the wage for the 8th day:

8th day wage = Total wage / 15 days
= $1260 / 15 days

where a is the smaller number.

2. When 9 is subtracted from each number, we get:

a - 9/3 = 5a - 9/3

3. Since the ratio of the new numbers is 12:23, we can set up a proportion:

12/3 = 5a - 9/3

4. Solving for a, we get:

5a - 9 = 12

5. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:

5a = 23

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, the remainder will be obtained.
2. The remainder will be divided by 18 to get Rahul's present age.
3. Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis, so we know that Rahul's present age is 5 years - 2 = 3 years.

Now, let's work out the problem:

1. If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age:

Ajay's present age - 6 = ?

We don't know Ajay's present age, so we can't solve this equation yet.

2. The remainder will be divided by 18 to get Rahul's present age:

Remainder / 18 = ?

We don't know the remainder yet, so we can't solve this equation yet.

3. Rahul is 2 years younger to Denis, so we know that Rahul's present age is 3 years:

Rahul's present age = Denis's present age - 2 = 5 - 2 = 3

Now we can solve for Ajay's present age:

Ajay's present age - 6 = ?

We know that the remainder when 6 is subtracted from Ajay's present age is 3, so we can set up the equation:

Ajay's present age - 6 = 3

Solving for Ajay's present age:

Ajay's present age = 3 + 6 = 9

There are 4 books in total, and we need to arrange them in every possible combination. Since there are 4 books, there are 4! = 24 possible combinations.

If Anna moves one book every minute, she will need to move 24 books in total.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, Anna will need to move one book every 60/24 = 2.5 minutes per book.

Therefore, the total time it will take Anna to arrange all 4 books in every possible combination and move one book every minute is:

2.5 minutes per book x 24 books = 60 minutes

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

So, the manufacturer is offering a 20% discount on the price of its tubeless tyres, which means that the original price of the tyres is:

100% - 20% = 80%

Now, if a retailer is offering an additional 20% discount, we need to find out what the new price of the tyres would be after the additional discount. To do this, we can multiply the original price by the additional discount percentage:

80% x 20% = 16%

So, the new price of the tyres after the additional discount would be:

80% - 16% = 64%

Therefore, the total discount available at the retailer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's start by identifying the information given in the problem:

1. The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is 60 kg.
2. One of the crew members, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man.

We can start by finding the weight of the new man:

Let x be the weight of the new man.

We know that the average weight of the 10 oarsmen is 60 kg, so the sum of their weights is:

60 kg = 10 x + 53 kg

Now, we are told that the weight of the new man is 53 kg, so we can substitute this value in for the x:

60 kg = 10 x + 53 kg

Now, we can solve for x:

10 x = 60 kg - 53 kg

10 x = 7 kg

x = 7 kg

So, the weight of the new man is 7 kg.

The answer is:

B) 62

Explanation:

The average weight of the 10 oarsmen is 60 kg, and the weight of the new man is 7 kg, so the total weight of the new crew is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

There are a few key things to note about this problem:

1. The box contains a certain number of balls, which we'll call n.
2. The balls are marked successively from 1 to n.
3. The problem states that the ball with number 3 marked on it cannot be selected.

Now, let's think about how we can select two balls from the box without selecting the ball with number 3. Here's one way to do it:

1. Select a ball with a number other than 3. There are n - 1 possible choices for this ball.
2. Select a ball with a number other than 3 and 1. There are n - 2 possible choices for this ball.

Since we're not allowed to select the ball with number 3, we can't choose the ball with number 1 either. So, the total number of ways to select two balls without selecting the ball with number 3 is:

(n - 1) x (n - 2)

Now, let's think about the factors of Q. We know that Q is a positive integer, so we can start by looking at the factors of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

1 has no factors, so we can eliminate I (Q is the square of a prime number) and II (Q is the fourth power of a prime number).

2 has only 1 and 2 as factors, so we can eliminate III (Q is the product of two prime numbers).

3 has 1, 3, and 9 as factors, so we can eliminate II (Q is the fourth power of a prime number).

4 has 1, 2, 4, and 8 as factors, so we can eliminate I (Q is the square of a prime number).

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

First, we know that the cost of renting a DVD without a membership is $4.00.

If we purchase a membership for $7.00 per month, the cost of renting a DVD with a membership is $2.00.

So, to determine the minimum number of DVDs we would need to rent to make it worth it to purchase a membership, we need to calculate the total cost of renting those DVDs without a membership versus the cost of the membership.

Let's assume we want to rent 5 DVDs. Here's how the math works out:

Without a membership:

5 DVDs x $4.00 per DVD = $20.00

With a membership:

5 DVDs x $2.00 per DVD = $10.00

As you can see, the cost of renting 5 DVDs with a membership is $10.00, which is less than the cost of renting the same number of DVDs without a membership ($20.00).

Therefore, the minimum number of DVDs you would need to rent to make it worth it to purchase a membership is 5.

2. Jill finishes the remaining 1/3 of the work, which is 1/3 x 12 = 4 hours.

Since Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, Jill can clean the remaining 4 hours of work in:

4 hours x (5% of Jack's rate) = 4 hours x 0.05 = 0.2 hours

Therefore, Jill takes 0.2 hours to finish the remaining work, which is equivalent to 12 minutes.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. The professor borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest.
2. After 3 years, the university received Rs. 300 as interest.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the problem:

Let the rate of interest be x%

Then, the amount of interest earned by the university can be calculated as:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is Rs. 5000, the rate is x%, and the time is 3 years.

So, the interest earned by the university is:

Interest = 5000 x x x 3

We know that the university received Rs. 300 as interest, so we can set up an equation:

5000 x x x 3 = 3000

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

So, we know that there was a discount of 20% on all articles, which means that the original price of the article was 100% of the sale price.

We also know that Vinit purchased the article for Rs. 4578 in the sale.

So, we can set up the equation:

Original price = Sale price x (100 / Discount percentage)

In this case, the original price would be:

Original price = Rs. 4578 x (100 / 20)

Original price = Rs. 4578 x 5

Original price = Rs. 2289

So, the original price of the article was Rs. 2289.

Now, we can find the actual selling price of the article by subtracting the discount amount from the sale price:

Actual selling price = Sale price - Discount amount

Actual selling price = Rs. 4578 - Rs. 20% of Rs. 4578

Actual selling price = Rs. 4578 - Rs. 915.60

Actual selling price = Rs. 3662.40

We know that the cost per bottle is A cents, so we can substitute that into the equation:

27 bottles x A cents = A cents

Now we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 27:

528 bottles x A cents = A cents

Since there are 528 bottles (27 x 20), we can see that the cost of 27 bottles is simply a fraction of the cost of 528 bottles. So, we can set up a proportion to solve for the cost of 27 bottles:

A cents / 27 bottles = A cents / 528 bottles

Now we can cross-multiply and simplify:

A cents / 27 bottles = 27 bottles x A cents / 528 bottles

A cents / 27 bottles = 27 x A cents / 528

A cents / 27 bottles = 27 x 100 / 528

A cents / 27 bottles = 100 / 27

Now we can simplify:

A cents / 27 bottles = 4

So, the cost of 27 bottles is 4 times the cost of one bottle. Therefore, the cost of one bottle is:

A cents / 27 bottles = 4

A cents / 1 bottle = 4 x A cents / 27

A cents / 1 bottle = 4 x A

A cents / 1 bottle = 4A

Now we can substitute the value we know:

A cents / 1 bottle = 4A

A cents = 4A

Now we can solve for A:

A = 4A / 100

A = 400

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's think step by step to find the answer.

1. We know that three candy bars will be selected from the 11 candy bars.
2. We know that three candy bars can be selected in $3\times 4$ ways, since there are 4 candy bars that cost $1 each and 4 candy bars that cost $2 each.
3. Now, we need to find the number of ways to select three candy bars such that the total cost is more than $4.
4. To do this, we need to find the number of ways to select three candy bars that have a total cost of at least $4.
5. Since the four candy bars that cost $1 each have a total cost of $4, we can select any one of these candy bars and two of the candy bars that cost $2 each.
6. Therefore, the number of ways to select three candy bars with a total cost of at least $4 is $4\times 2\times 4 = 32$.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Since the team has 4 men and 4 women, we can choose the first presenter in 4 ways (4 men, 4 women).

For the second presenter, we have 3 options:

1. Choose a man if the first presenter is a man.
2. Choose a woman if the first presenter is a woman.
3. Choose anyone regardless of the gender of the first presenter.

So, we have 3 x 4 = 12 options for the second presenter.

For the third presenter, we have 2 options:

1. Choose a man if the first two presenters are both men.
2. Choose a woman if the first two presenters are both women.

So, we have 2 x 12 = 24 options for the third presenter.

For the fourth presenter, we have the same options as the third presenter: 2 x 24 = 48 options.

In total, we have:

12 x 12 x 24 x 48 = 19,680

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

Let's start with the information that exactly 2/5 of the children in the class are girls. This means that the number of girls is 2/5 of the total number of children in the class.

We know that there are 100 boys in the class, so the total number of children in the class is:

100 + 2/5(100) = 100 + 2\*20 = 100 + 40 = 140

So, there are 140 children in the class in total.

Now, we know that 2/5 of the children in the class are girls, so the number of girls is:

140 / 5 = 28

The answer is:

The answer is 28.

Therefore, there are 28 girls in the class.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

To determine the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of relatively prime pairs in S x {1,000}.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Find the prime factors of 1,000:

1,000 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7

2. Find the prime factors of each number in S:

1 = 1 x 1
2 = 2 x 1
3 = 3 x 1
4 = 2 x 2
5 = 5 x 1
6 = 2 x 3
7 = 7 x 1
8 = 2 x 2 x 1
9 = 3 x 3
10 = 2 x 5
...
1,000 = 2 x 2 x 5 x 5 x 7

3. Identify the numbers in S that have no common factors with 1,000:

The only numbers in S that have no common factors with 1,000 are 1, 3, 7, and 9.

4. Calculate the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000:

The probability is equal to the number of relatively prime pairs in S x {1,000} divided by the total number of pairs in S:

Probability = (4/1000) x (1/1) = 4/1000

The answer is C) 4/7.

So, the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 4/7.",D

We know that Charles received $54,080 at the end of the one-year investment period, which includes both the principal and interest. We also know that the investment paid an annual interest rate of 8%, compounded semi-annually.

First, let's calculate the interest earned on the investment for the first six months:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Interest = $45,000 x 8% x 0.5 (6 months)

Interest = $3,200

Now, we add the interest to the principal to find the total amount of money Charles had invested:

Total = Principal + Interest

Total = $45,000 + $3,200

Total = $48,200

Now, we can calculate the interest earned for the second six months:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Interest = $48,200 x 8% x 0.5 (6 months)

Interest = $3,696

Now, we add the interest to the total amount of money Charles had invested:

Total = Total + Interest

Total = $48,200 + $3,696

Total = $51,896

So, the amount of money Charles originally invested is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's break down the information given:

1. Joe's age, his sister's age, and their father's age sum up to 100.
2. When Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now.
3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as her father.

Let's assume Joe's age is x. Then, his sister's age is 2x, and their father's age is 3x.

From the first condition, we have:

x + 2x + 3x = 100

Simplifying, we get:

6x = 100

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

x = 16

So, Joe's age is 16.

Now, let's check the second condition:

When Joe is 16 (i.e., as old as his father), his sister will be twice as old as she is now.

So, his sister's current age is 2x = 2(16) = 32.

Finally, we can find their father's age:

When Joe is 16 (i.e., as old as his father), his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as her father.

So, their father's age when his daughter was 32 = 3x = 3(16) = 48.

D) 19
E) 11
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this step by step!

Given that one third of 3/4 of a number is 21, we can start by finding 3/4 of the number.

3/4 of a number is equal to 3 x 4/4, which simplifies to 3 x 1 = 3.

So, 3/4 of the number is 3.

Now, we know that one third of 3 is 3/3, which simplifies to 1.

So, one third of the number is 1.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

1/3 of the number = 21

To solve for the number, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

3/3 of the number = 21 x 3

3/3 of the number = 63

Now, we can simplify the right side of the equation:

3/3 of the number = 63

3/3 = 21

The number = 63

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 63.

D) 2500 / y
E) 5000 / y
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this step by step!

Given:

m > 0 (m is a positive number)
y > 0 (y is a positive number)
x = m/100 * 4y (x is a percentage of 4y)

We can start by simplifying the expression for x:

x = m/100 * 4y
= m * 4/100 * y
= 4m/100 * y

Now, we can see that 4m/100 is a percentage of y, so we can find the percentage of x in terms of y by finding the percentage of 4m/100 in terms of y:

4m/100 = (4m/100) / 100
= (4m/100) / y

So, the percentage of x in terms of y is:

(4m/100) / y

The answer is:

C) 50y

Explanation:

We know that 4m/100 is a percentage of y, so we can write it as a percentage of y. Since 4m/100 is equal to 50, we can see that the percentage of x in terms of y is 50y.",D

We know that there is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election, so we can use this information to find the probability that exactly four of the five randomly chosen voters voted in the last election.

Here's one way to approach this problem:

1. Find the probability that all five voters voted in the last election:

P(all five vote) = (0.9)^5 = 0.8144 (or 81.44%)
2. Find the probability that exactly four voters voted in the last election:

P(exactly four vote) = 1 - P(all five vote) = 1 - 0.8144 = 0.1856 (or 18.56%)

So, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five randomly chosen voters voted in the last election is 18.56%.

B) 62
C) 66
D) 70
E) 74
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this together!

The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters, and Alice wants to fence three sides of the yard. So, we can start by finding the length of one side of the yard.

Let's call the length of one side ""x"" meters. Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, we know that x + 10 = 240 (since the area of the unfenced side is 10 meters).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the area of the fenced sides:

3(x) = 3(240)

Simplifying, we get:

3x = 720

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 720 / 3

x = 240

So, the length of one side of the yard is 240 meters.

Now, we can find the length of the other two sides:

Since Alice wants to fence three sides, we know that the total length of the fenced sides is 3x = 3(240) = 720 meters.

Let's call the length of the second side ""y"" meters. Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, we know that y + 10 = 720.

Simplifying, we get:

y = 720 - 10

y = 710

So, the length of the second side is 710 meters.

Now, we can find the length of the third side:

Since the total length of the fenced sides is 720 meters, and we know that the length of the second side is 710 meters, we can find the length of the third side by subtracting the length of the second side from the total length:

3z = 720 - 710

3z = 10

z = 10 / 3

z = 33

So, the length of the third side is 33 meters.

Now, we can find the total length of fencing needed:

The total length of fencing needed is the sum of the lengths of the",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this step by step!

1. First, we know that the middle letter must be a vowel, so we have 5 vowels to choose from: A, E, I, O, and U.
2. The first letter and the third letter must be consonants, so we have 20 consonants to choose from.
3. The first letter and the third letter must be different, so we need to choose 2 different consonants.
4. Since the middle letter is a vowel, it cannot be the first or third letter.

Now, let's count the number of possible codes we can make:

1. We can choose any vowel for the middle letter, so there are 5 choices for the middle letter.
2. For the first letter, we can choose any of the 20 consonants that are not the middle letter.
3. For the third letter, we can choose any of the remaining 19 consonants that are not the middle letter or the first letter.

D) 30
E) 39
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

We know that the product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729.

Let's call the first integer x, the second integer x + 1, and the third integer x + 2.

We know that the product of these three integers is 727 + 728 + 729, so we can write:

x(x + 1)(x + 2) = 727 + 728 + 729

Now, we can simplify this equation by expanding the product:

x(x + 1)(x + 2) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x

Since the product of three consecutive integers is always positive, we know that the leading coefficient (the first term) must be positive. Therefore, the leading coefficient of x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x must be 1.

So, we can simplify the equation further:

x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x = 1(x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x) = 1

Now, we can see that the only way for the equation to be true is for x = 1, since 1 is the only number that can be multiplied by 1 to give 1.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 1.

So, the three consecutive integers are 1, 2, and 3.",E

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work it out step by step!

The formula to find the capacity of a tank is:

Capacity = Length x Width x Height

In this case, the tank is 8 m long, 6 m wide, and 2.5 m high, so we can plug those values into the formula:

Capacity = 8 m x 6 m x 2.5 m

Now, we need to convert all the measurements to the same unit of measurement, let's use liters.

1 meter = 1000 liters (we know this from the conversion factor)

So,

8 m = 8 x 1000 liters = 8000 liters
6 m = 6 x 1000 liters = 6000 liters
2.5 m = 2.5 x 1000 liters = 2500 liters

Now we can multiply all the values together:

Capacity = 8000 liters x 6000 liters x 2500 liters
