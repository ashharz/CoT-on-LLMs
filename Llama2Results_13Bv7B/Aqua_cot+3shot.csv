Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Given:

* The car is driving in a straight line towards the base of a vertical tower.
* The top of the tower is observed from the car.
* It takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

We can start by finding the height of the tower. We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so we can use trigonometry to find the height of the tower.

Let's use the tangent ratio formula:

tan(60°) = opposite / adjacent

We know that the opposite side is the height of the tower, and the adjacent side is the distance between the car and the tower (which is constant since the car is driving in a straight line).

So, we can set up the equation:

opposite = tan(60°) x adjacent

We know that the adjacent side is the distance between the car and the tower, which is given as 10 minutes x (distance between the car and the tower) = 10 x distance

Now, we can substitute the values and solve for the height of the tower:

opposite = tan(60°) x 10 x distance

opposite = 10 x distance x tan(60°)

opposite = 10 x distance x √3

Since the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, we know that the height of the tower is equal to the opposite side:

height = opposite

height = 10 x distance x √3

Now, we need to find the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. We know that the car is driving at a uniform speed, so we can use the formula:

time = distance / speed

We know that the distance is given as 10 minutes x distance, and the speed is constant. So, we can substitute the values and solve for the time:

time = 10 x distance / speed

time = 10 x (10 x distance) / speed

time = 100 x distance / speed

Now, we can substitute the",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item.
2. The discounted price of the item was 22% of the original price.
3. The customer used a $20-off coupon.

Now, let's calculate the original price of the item:

1.90 = (1/2) \* original price + 20

Simplifying the equation:

1.90 = (1/2) \* original price + 20

D) 0.46
E) 0.63
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's define two events:

Event A: Stock A increases in value during the next month.
Event B: Stock B increases in value during the next month.

We know that the probability of Event A is 0.56, and the probability of Event B is 0.74.

We want to find the probability that neither Event A nor Event B occurs. This means we need to find the probability that neither stock increases in value.

We can use the Inclusive-OR rule, which states that the probability of neither event occurring is equal to the probability of neither event occurring plus the probability of one event occurring.

So, we can write:

P(neither event occurs) = P(A does not occur) + P(B does not occur)

We know that P(A does not occur) = 1 - P(A occurs), and P(B does not occur) = 1 - P(B occurs).

Substituting these values, we get:

P(neither event occurs) = 1 - P(A occurs) + 1 - P(B occurs)

Simplifying, we get:

P(neither event occurs) = 1 - 0.56 + 1 - 0.74

Simplifying further, we get:

P(neither event occurs) = 1 - 0.56 + 1 - 0.74

P(neither event occurs) = 0.46

So, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.46.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag, and all of them were painted black. So, the number of white marbles left in the bag is 20 - 20 = 0.
2. Next, we know that 1 black marble was pulled out of the 20 marbles pulled out the second time. So, the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time is 1/20 = 0.05 (or 5%).
3. Now, we can use the information that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag. So, if 5% of the marbles pulled out the second time were black, that means there are 5% of the total marbles in the bag that are black.
4. We know that there are a total of 20 marbles in the bag (20 white marbles and 1 black marble). So, the number of black marbles in the bag is 20 x 0.05 = 1.

E) 15
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The train is running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, so it covers 100 miles in 1 hour.
2. After covering a quarter of the distance, the train has to slow down to 75 miles/hour.
3. We can find the total distance traveled by the train by multiplying the speed by the time taken:

100 miles/hour x 10 hours = 1000 miles

So, the total distance traveled by the train is 1000 miles.

Now, we need to find the total journey duration, which is the time taken to cover the total distance. We know that the train slowed down to 75 miles/hour after covering a quarter of the distance, so we can find the time taken to cover the remaining distance:

1000 miles / 75 miles/hour = 13.33 hours

Since the train slowed down after covering a quarter of the distance, we need to add the time taken to cover the first quarter of the distance to the time taken to cover the remaining distance:

10 hours + 13.33 hours = 23.33 hours

Therefore, the total journey duration is 23.33 hours.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, which means that 45% of 200 is at least 90 students (since 90 is more than 45% of 200).
2. At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, which means that 35% of 200 is at least 70 students (since 70 is more than 35% of 200).
3. Since there are only 200 students in total, we can deduce that the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is the difference between the total number of students and the sum of the students who attended the prom night and the debating session:

Maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session = 200 - (90 + 70)

A) 15
B) 24
C) 25
D) 40
E) 52
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let X be the number of sales the salesperson makes.

Since the salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale, the total amount earned from each sale is:

10% of $250 = $25

So, the total amount earned from X sales is:

$25 x X

The salesperson needs to earn at least $1000, so we set up the equation:

$25 x X >= $1000

Now, we can solve for X:

$25 x X = $1000

X = $1000 / $25

X = 40

So, the answer is D) 40. The salesperson must make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000 with a 10% commission on each sale.",D

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit ( revenue from sales minus production costs ) will be at least $ 626,400 ?
Answer Choices:
A) 226
B) 230
C) 240
D) 260
E) 280
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we know that the company sells all 420 components every month, so the total revenue from sales is 420 x $x, where x is the selling price per component.

The production cost per component is $110, so the total production cost per month is 420 x $110 = $46,200.

The yearly profit is the total revenue from sales minus the total production cost, so we want to find the selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

We can set up an equation to represent this:

Yearly Profit = Total Revenue - Total Production Cost

Yearly Profit = 420 x $x - $46,200

We know that the yearly profit is at least $626,400, so we can set up an inequality:

420 x $x - $46,200 >= 626,400

Now, we can simplify the equation:

420 x $x >= 666,600

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we can set $x = 666,600 / 420:

x = $159.60

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) $240.

At this selling price, the yearly profit would be:

Yearly Profit = 420 x $240 - $46,200
= 92,400 - 46,200
= 46,200

Which is greater than or equal to $626,400, so the company would make a profit of at least $626,400 per year if they sell the components at $240 each.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so 10% of the total number of staplers produced on Monday were defective.
* 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so 2% of the remaining staplers (i.e. the non-defective ones) were rejected.

Now, let's use the information we have to find the total number of staplers produced on Monday:

1. First, we'll find the number of defective staplers:
10% of 4000 (total number of staplers produced on Monday) is:
10% x 4000 = 400 defective staplers

2. Now, we'll find the number of non-defective staplers:
4000 - 400 = 3600 non-defective staplers

3. Now, we'll find the number of staplers rejected by mistake:
2% of 3600 non-defective staplers is:
2% x 3600 = 72 rejected staplers

So, the total number of staplers produced on Monday is:
3600 - 72 = 3528.

D) 1.2
E) 1.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that A and B are independent events, which means that the probability of A occurring does not depend on the occurrence of B, and vice versa.

We also know that P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8.

To find P(A/B), we can use the formula:

P(A/B) = P(A) x P(B) / P(A ∩ B)

In this case, P(A ∩ B) = 0, since A and B are independent events, so we can simplify the formula to:

P(A/B) = P(A) x P(B)

Substituting the values we know, we get:

P(A/B) = 0.2 x 0.8 = 0.16

Therefore, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze the situation:

1. If you walk 20 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 10 minutes.
2. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you reach the bottom in 20 minutes.

From these two statements, we can infer that the elevator moves at a constant speed. Let's call this speed ""x"" steps per minute.

Now, we can set up two equations based on the information given:

Equation 1:
20x = 10 (since you reach the bottom in 10 minutes if you walk 20 steps)

Equation 2:
10x = 20 (since you reach the bottom in 20 minutes if you walk 10 steps)

Solving these equations, we get:

x = 2 (since both equations have the same solution)

Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 2 steps per minute.

E) ( zy – x) / ( z + 2)
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we know that the average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. This means that the average of the remaining scores (excluding the highest and lowest) is equal to x + (z - 2)y / z, where z is the number of students in the class.

Now, we are asked to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. To do this, we need to subtract the highest score and the lowest score from the total number of scores.

Let's denote the highest score as h and the lowest score as l. Then, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:

(z - 2)y / z - (h + l)

Simplifying this expression, we get:

(z - 2)y / z - (h + l) = (z - 2)y / z - (h + l) / z

Now, we can simplify further by canceling out the z terms:

(z - 2)y / z - (h + l) / z = (y - 2) / z

So, the answer is:

The answer is (y - 2) / z.

Therefore, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is equal to the average score of the remaining scores minus 2, divided by the number of students in the class minus 2.",D

E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour. This means that for every bag of flour he sells, he earns a profit of 25% of the selling price.

We know that the grocer makes $3,000 in profit. Since the profit is a percentage of the selling price, we can set up the equation:

Profit = (Selling Price x Profit Percentage)

In this case, the selling price is $100, and the profit percentage is 25%. So, we can substitute these values into the equation:

Profit = ($100 x 25%)

Simplifying, we get:

Profit = $25

Now, we know that the grocer makes $25 in profit for each bag of flour he sells. To find out how many bags he sold, we can divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

Bags Sold = Profit / Profit Per Bag

Bags Sold = $3,000 / $25

Bags Sold = 120

So, the answer is:

The answer is 120 bags.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so he makes 35 toys in 7 hours, which means he makes 35/7 = 5 toys per hour.
2. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he makes 35 toys in 9 hours, which means he makes 35/9 = 4 toys per hour.
3. Since both Alex and Jacob have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that they have worked for the same number of hours, let's say x hours.
4. Alex makes 5 toys per hour, so he makes 5x toys in x hours.
5. Jacob makes 4 toys per hour, so he makes 4x toys in x hours.
6. Since they have worked for the same number of hours, the total number of toys made by Alex and Jacob is the same: 35.
7. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 5x = 4x + 35.
8. Solving for x, we get: x = 35/4 = 8.5.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1/16 of the students study math, so there are 16 students studying math.
1/10 of the students study bio, so there are 10 students studying bio.
1/8 of the students study english, so there are 8 students studying english.

Total number of students = 16 + 10 + 8 = 34 students.

Since the total number of students is a 4-digit number, we know that the maximum number of students is 9999 (9999 - 34 = 9965).

The minimum number of students is 34, which is the number of students we have already found.

Therefore, the difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:

Maximum number of students - Minimum number of students = 9999 - 34 = 9965 - 34 = 9931.

How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes ? Round to the nearest hundredth .
Answer Choices:
A) 2 miles
B) 2.25 miles
C) 3.25 miles
D) 3.85 miles
E) 2.85 miles
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

On a normal day, Bill's average speed is 15 mph, so we can calculate his distance traveled in 21 minutes as follows:

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 15 mph x 21 minutes
Distance = 315 meters (rounded to the nearest meter)

Now, on a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his new speed is:

New Speed = Original Speed - Wind Speed
New Speed = 15 mph - 4 mph
New Speed = 11 mph

Since the distance traveled is proportional to the speed, we can calculate the distance traveled on a windy day as follows:

Distance = New Speed x Time
Distance = 11 mph x 21 minutes
Distance = 231.5 meters (rounded to the nearest meter)

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 2.25 miles.

C) 127 km
D) 228 km
E) 128 km
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey, so the distance = speed x time = (speed) x 6 hours.
2. In the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so the new speed = old speed + 12 km/hr = (old speed) + 12 km/hr.
3. The jeep takes 4 hours to cover the same distance in the return journey, so the distance = new speed x time = ((old speed) + 12 km/hr) x 4 hours.

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

distance = (old speed) x 6 hours + 12 km/hr x 4 hours

We know that the old speed is 128 km/hr, so we can substitute that value:

distance = 128 km/hr x 6 hours + 12 km/hr x 4 hours

Simplifying, we get:

distance = 768 km + 48 km

distance = 816 km

B) 28 %
C) 36 %
D) 40 %
E) 42 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, the original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost, which means the wholesale cost was:

Wholesale cost = Retail price / (1 + 0.6)
= Retail price / 1.6

Since the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, the sold price is:

Sold price = Retail price - (20% of Retail price)
= Retail price - (0.2 x Retail price)
= Retail price - 0.2 x Retail price

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

Sold price = Retail price / (1 + 0.6) - 0.2 x Retail price
= Retail price / 1.6 - 0.2 x Retail price

We want to find the percentage increase of the sold price over the wholesale cost, so we need to find the ratio of the sold price to the wholesale cost:

(Sold price / Wholesale cost) x 100

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

(Sold price / Wholesale cost) x 100
= (Retail price / 1.6 - 0.2 x Retail price) / Wholesale cost x 100
= (Retail price / 1.6) / Wholesale cost x 100 - 0.2 x Retail price / Wholesale cost x 100

Simplifying and solving for the percentage increase, we get:

(Sold price / Wholesale cost) x 100
= (Retail price / 1.6) / Wholesale cost x 100 - 0.2 x Retail price / Wholesale cost x 100
= (Retail price / 1.6) / Wholesale cost x 100 - 0.2 x Retail price / Wholesale cost x 100

Find the area of the sheet .
Answer Choices:
A) 1584
B) 1120
C) 792
D) 1320
E) 1200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the problem. We know that the sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set of sides, and a perimeter of 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides. This means that the length of the sheet is the same for both folds, so we can let the length of the sheet be x cm.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of the sheet is 48 cm, so the sum of the lengths of the four sides is 48 cm. Since the sheet is rectangular, we know that the sum of the lengths of the four sides is equal to the perimeter of the sheet. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

x + x + x + x = 48

Similarly, when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of the sheet is 66 cm, so the sum of the lengths of the four sides is 66 cm. Therefore, we can set up another equation:

x + x + x + x = 66

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and x). Can you solve for x and find the area of the sheet?

The answer is:

C) 792

Explanation:

We can solve the first equation for x:

x = 48 / 4

x = 12

Now we can substitute this value of x into the second equation:

x + x + x + x = 66

12 + 12 + 12 + 12 = 66

48 + 48 = 66

Therefore, the area of the sheet is 792 cm^2 (since the length of the sheet is 12 cm and the width is also 12 cm).",B

A) 13.3542
B) 15.8113
C) 18.3451
D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by looking at the dimensions of the rectangular solid:

3 x 4 x 15 = 3 x 4 x (15 x 15) = 3 x 4 x 225 = 3 x 4 x 800

Since all eight vertices of the rectangular solid are on the sphere, we know that the sphere must have a diameter of at least 800.

Now, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere (V = (4/3)πr^3) to find the radius of the sphere:

V = (4/3)πr^3

We know that the volume of the sphere is equal to the volume of the rectangular solid, so we can set up an equation:

(4/3)πr^3 = 800

Now, we can solve for r:

r^3 = (800/(4/3)) = 800^3 = 504

r = √504 = 22

So, the diameter of the sphere is:

diameter = 2 x r = 2 x 22 = 44

Answer Choices:
A) Rs . 697.50
B) Rs . 712.50
C) Rs . 787.50
D) Rs . 750
E) Rs . 780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let the marked price of the watch be x.

If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, the selling price (SP) is:

SP = x - (5% of x)
= x - (x/20)
= x - x/4
= 3x/4

So, the profit (P) is:

P = SP - cost price (CP)
= 3x/4 - CP

If the shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit when he gives a discount of 7%, we can set up the equation:

3x/4 - CP = 15

Now, we can solve for CP:

CP = 3x/4 + 15
= 3x/4 + 15/4
= 3x + 3

So, the marked price of the watch is:

x = 3x + 3
= 3(3x + 3)
= 9x + 9

We can write the correct answer as:

7/8 x = 7/18 x + (7/8 - 7/18) x

Since the student found 7/18 x, we can substitute that in the above equation:

7/8 x = 7/18 x + (7/8 - 7/18) x

Simplifying the equation:

7/8 x = 7/18 x + (1/8) x

Now, we can see that the difference between the correct answer and the student's answer is:

7/8 x - 7/18 x = (1/8) x

Since the student's answer differed from the actual answer by 770, we can set up the equation:

(1/8) x = 770

Solving for x, we get:

x = 770 x 8 = 6,240

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The monthly salary of the shop assistant, S, is given by:

S = 500 + 0.05 \* (monthly sales)

We know that the shop assistant's monthly salary is $1500, so we can set up the equation:

S = 1500

Now, we can solve for the monthly sales by substituting the expression for S into the equation:

1500 = 500 + 0.05 \* (monthly sales)

Subtracting 500 from both sides gives us:

1000 = 0.05 \* (monthly sales)

Dividing both sides by 0.05 gives us:

20000 = monthly sales

Therefore, the answer is C) $30,000. The monthly sales need to be $30,000 for the shop assistant's monthly salary to reach $1500.",D

C) 458
D) 156
E) 452
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The plane flies along the four sides of a square, so it covers four sides of equal length.
2. The speeds of the plane are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr.
3. Since the plane flies along the four sides of the square, it covers each side twice, so we need to double each speed.
4. The total distance covered by the plane around the field is the sum of the distances of all four sides:

Distance = 2 x (200 km/hr x 2) + 2 x (400 km/hr x 2) + 2 x (600 km/hr x 2) + 2 x (800 km/hr x 2)

= 2 x (400 km) + 2 x (800 km) + 2 x (1200 km) + 2 x (1600 km)

= 800 km + 1600 km + 2400 km + 3200 km

= 6800 km

5. The average speed of the plane around the field is the total distance covered divided by the time taken:

Average Speed = Total Distance / Time Taken
= 6800 km / 4 sides
= 1700 km/side

So, the answer is C) 458 km/hr, which is the average speed of the plane around the field.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners.
2. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners.
3. So, the cost of each white sharpeners is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpeners.
4. The total cost of 18 sharpeners is 100 rupees.

Now, let's find out how many white and brown sharpeners Jack bought:

Let x be the number of brown sharpeners.
Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners, the cost of x white sharpeners is x + 1 rupees.
The total cost of x brown sharpeners and x white sharpeners is:

x + (x + 1) = 2x + 1

Since the total cost is 100 rupees, we can set up the equation:

2x + 1 = 100

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 99

x = 49

So, Jack bought 49 brown sharpeners and 49 + 1 = 50 white sharpeners.

E) 5 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we know that 120 is reduced to 96. To find the reduction percentage, we can use the following formula:

Redction percentage = (new value - old value) / old value

In this case, the new value is 96 and the old value is 120, so we can plug those values into the formula like this:

Redction percentage = (96 - 120) / 120

Simplifying, we get:

Redction percentage = (96 - 120) / 120
= (96 - 120) / 120
= -24 / 120
= -1 / 5

So, the reduction percentage is 1/5, or 20%.

C) 76523
D) 24567
E) 43566
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze the given information:

1. The number is 5 digits long.
2. With a 1 after it, the number is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.

Now, let's try to find the number by working backwards. If the number with a 1 after it is three times as large as the number with a 1 before it, then the number with a 1 before it must be half of the original number.

So, the original number is twice the number with a 1 before it. Therefore, the number with a 1 before it is half of the original number, and the original number is twice that number.

Now, we can set up an equation based on this:

Original number = 2 x (half of the original number)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Original number = 2 x (half of the original number)

Original number = 2 x (half(original number))

Now, we can solve for the original number by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

Original number = half(original number)

Now, we can find the original number by solving for half(original number) and multiplying it by 2:

half(original number) = 24567

Therefore, the original number is:

Original number = 2 x 24567

Original number = 49134

* 24% of all students are members of both the chess club and the swim team.
* 20% of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club.

We can start by finding out how many students are members of the swim team:

24% of all students = 24/100 = 0.24 x 100 = 24

So, there are 24 students who are members of the swim team.

Now, we need to find out how many of those 24 students are not members of the chess club:

20% of members of the swim team = 20/100 = 0.2 x 24 = 4.8

So, there are 4.8 students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club.

Now, we can find the percentage of all Daifu students who are members of the swim team:

(24 - 4.8) / 100 = (24 - 4.8) / 100 = 24 - 4.8 = 20

C) 1.50
D) 1.75
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's assume the distance between the two cars at the starting point is 0 miles.

The first car is traveling at 12 mph, so it will cover 50 miles in:

50 miles / 12 mph = 4.17 hours (approximately)

The second car is traveling at 13 mph, so it will cover 50 miles in:

50 miles / 13 mph = 3.85 hours (approximately)

Now, we need to find the time at which the two cars will meet. We know that the first car will take 4.17 hours to cover 50 miles, and the second car will take 3.85 hours to cover 50 miles. So, the time at which they will meet is:

B) 415000
C) 31500
D) 50000
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The servant's monthly salary is 1500, and the commission is 15% of the monthly sale. So, the servant's total income per month is:

1500 + (15% of monthly sale)

To get the servant's monthly income to be 6000, we need to find the monthly sale that will give us a total income of 6000.

So, we can set up the equation:

1500 + (15% of x) = 6000

Where x is the monthly sale.

Now, we can solve for x:

1500 + (15% of x) = 6000

1500 + 0.15x = 6000

0.15x = 6000 - 1500

0.15x = 4500

x = 4500 / 0.15

x = 30000

So, the servant needs to make a monthly sale of 30000 to get a total income of 6000.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The man borrows Rs. 360, and he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. To find the interest rate, we need to find the amount of interest paid by the borrower.

First, let's calculate the total amount paid by the borrower over the 12 months:

12 monthly installments x Rs. 31.50 per month = Rs. 378

So, the total amount paid by the borrower is Rs. 378. Now, we can calculate the interest paid by the borrower:

Total amount paid - Principal amount = Interest paid
Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18

Now, we can calculate the interest rate as a percentage of the principal amount:

Interest rate = (Interest paid / Principal amount) x 100
= (Rs. 18 / Rs. 360) x 100
= 5%

Therefore, the answer is D) 5%.",D

So, the price of the product is reduced by 30%, which means we need to find 30% of the original price.

30% of $100 = $30

So, the new price of the product is $100 - $30 = $70.

B) 651
C) 400
D) 487
E) 286
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let x be the number of 25 paise coins, y be the number of 50 paise coins, and z be the number of one rupee coins.

We know that the total amount of money in the pouch is Rs. 700, so we can write the equation:

x + y + z = 700

We also know that the number of coins is equal, so we can write:

x + y + z = 3(x)

Now, we can solve the system of equations. We know that x + y + z = 700 and x + y + z = 3(x), so we can substitute x + y + z = 700 into the second equation:

3x + 3y + 3z = 3(700)

Simplifying, we get:

3x + 3y + 3z = 2100

Now, we can solve for x, y, and z. We can start by solving for x:

x = 2100 / 3

x = 700

Now we can solve for y:

y = 2100 / 3

y = 700

Now we can solve for z:

z = 2100 / 3

z = 700

So, the answer is:

12 1/2% of Rs. 3500 = (12 1/2/100) x Rs. 3500 = 12.5 x Rs. 3500 = Rs. 437.50

So, the man saves Rs. 437.50 per month.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Mr. Brown can paint a house in 6 days.
2. Mr. Black would take 8 days to paint a house.
3. Mr. Blue would take 12 days to paint a house.
4. After 8 days, Mr. Brown goes on vacation, and Mr. Black starts working for 6 days.

Now, let's think about how much of the work Mr. Black can do in 6 days:

6 days x 8 days per house = 48 days of work

Since Mr. Brown did 8 days of work before going on vacation, the total amount of work done by both Mr. Brown and Mr. Black is:

48 days + 8 days = 56 days

Now, we need to find out how much of the work Mr. Blue can do in the remaining 12 - 8 = 4 days.

4 days x 12 days per house = 48 days of work

So, the total amount of work done by all three painters is:

56 days + 48 days = 104 days

Now, we need to find out how many days it would take Mr. Blue to complete the contract. Since there are 3 houses to be painted, we can divide the total work by 3:

104 days / 3 = 34.67 days

C) 190 minutes
D) 70 minutes
E) 35 minutes
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

So, Train A leaves the station every 16 minutes, and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. This means that the difference between their departure times is:

17 - 16 = 1 minute

Since both trains leave simultaneously, we can say that the next time they will leave simultaneously is when Train A's next departure time is equal to Train B's current departure time.

Train A's next departure time is 16 minutes after the current time, and Train B's current departure time is 17 minutes after the current time. So, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17.

The LCM of 16 and 17 is 190.

Therefore, the next time both trains will leave the station simultaneously is 190 minutes from now.

C) 500
D) 450
E) 498
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The hollow cube of size 5 cm has a volume of 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm = 125 cubic centimeters.
2. Since the thickness of the cube is 1 cm, the volume of the smaller cubes is 1 cm x 1 cm x 1 cm = 1 cubic centimeter.
3. To find out how many smaller cubes fit in the larger cube, we divide the volume of the larger cube by the volume of the smaller cube: 125 cubic centimeters / 1 cubic centimeter = 125 smaller cubes.
4. Since each smaller cube has 6 faces (3 on each of its three dimensions), there are a total of 6 x 125 = 750 faces on all the smaller cubes.
5. However, we only need to paint the outer surface of the larger cube, which means we only need to paint 5 cm x 5 cm x 5 cm = 125 cubic centimeters of surface area.
6. Since each smaller cube covers 1 cubic centimeter of surface area, we need to paint 125 / 1 = 125 smaller cubes.

The answer is C) 500.

So, 500 faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: The sum of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers can be represented as:

n + (n + 1) + (n + 2) + (n + 3) + (n + 4)

Since the sum is divided by 10, we know that each number must be a perfect square. Let's find the perfect squares of the above expression:

n + n + 1 + n + 2 + n + 3 + n + 4

Using the formula for the perfect square of a number, we can rewrite the expression as:

n^2 + n + 2n + 3n + 4n

Now, we can see that each term is a perfect square:

n^2 + n + 2n + 3n + 4n = (n + 1)^2

So, the answer is C) 41, as (41 + 1)^2 = 41^2 + 2\*41 + 1^2 = 1641, which is a perfect square.

C) 29
D) Can not be determined
E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

R is younger than Q as much as Q is older than T.

We know that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years.

Let's assume R's age is x years, then T's age is 50 - x years.

Since R is younger than Q, Q's age must be greater than R's age, so we can write:

Q's age = x + y, where y is the difference between R and Q's ages.

Now, we know that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years, so we can write:

x + (50 - x) = 50

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x = 50

x = 25

So, R's age is 25 years, and T's age is 50 - 25 = 25 years.

Now, we can find the difference between R and Q's ages:

Q's age = x + y = 25 + y

Since Q is older than R by y years, we can write:

y = 25

So, the difference between R and Q's ages is 25 years.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze the given information:

1. Sachin's current batting average is 51.
2. In the finals, he scores 78 runs.

We know that the batting average is calculated by dividing the number of runs scored by the number of innings played. So, if Sachin scores 78 runs in the finals and his current batting average is 51, we can calculate his new batting average as follows:

New Batting Average = (78 / x)

where x is the number of innings played in the finals.

Since Sachin scored 78 runs in the finals, we can set up the equation:

78 = 51x

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 78 / 51

x = 1.51

So, Sachin played 1.51 innings in the finals. Since we are looking for the total number of matches played by Sachin in the season, we need to multiply the number of innings played in the finals by the number of matches played in the season:

Total Matches = 1.51 x 11

Total Matches = 16.51

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 9.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. Since each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or a pair of letters, we can start by considering the smallest number of letters needed to represent each type of book.
2. The smallest number of letters needed to represent a single type of book is 1 (a single letter).
3. The smallest number of letters needed to represent two types of books is 2 (a pair of letters).
4. Since we have 10 types of books, we can represent 10 books with 10 single letters, or 5 books with 2 letters each.

Now, let's compare the two options:

Option 1: Representing each book with a single letter.

We need 10 single letters to represent the 10 types of books, so the total number of letters needed is 10.

Option 2: Representing each book with a pair of letters.

We need 5 pairs of letters to represent the 10 types of books, so the total number of letters needed is 5 x 2 = 10.

Since both options require 10 letters, the smallest number of letters needed to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 10.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by given information:

* The rectangular piece has an area of 150 sq m.
* The length is 1 m more than 4 times the breadth.

We can start by finding the breadth of the rectangular piece. Since the area is 150 sq m, the breadth must be:

150 sq m / (4 x breadth) = 150 sq m / 4 = breadth = 37.5 m

Now, we can find the length of the rectangular piece:

Length = 4 x breadth + 1
= 4 x 37.5 + 1
= 150 m

So, the length of the rectangular piece is 150 m.

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangular piece:

Perimeter = 2 x (length + breadth)
= 2 x (150 + 37.5)
= 2 x 187.5
= 375 m

Therefore, the answer is:

C) 12.5
D) 14.5
E) 16.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

We know that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how many grams of the health food we need to eat daily to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to first find out how much of each vitamin is present in one gram of the health food.

Let's start with vitamin E. We know that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, so we can set up the following equation:

9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E = x (where x is the amount of vitamin E in one gram of the health food)

We know that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 15 mg, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

9% of 15 mg = x

Now we can solve for x:

x = 15 mg x 9/100 = 1.35 mg

So, one gram of the health food contains 1.35 mg of vitamin E.

Now let's find out how much of vitamin A is present in one gram of the health food. We know that one gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, so we can set up the following equation:

8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A = x (where x is the amount of vitamin A in one gram of the health food)

We know that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 900 mcg, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

8% of 900 mcg = x

Now we can solve for x:

x = 900 mcg x 8/100 = 72 mcg

So, one gram of the health food contains 72 mcg of vitamin A.

Now that we know how much of each vitamin is present in one gram of the health food, we can calculate how many grams we need to eat daily to meet the minimum daily requirements of both vitamins",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
2. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
3. A total of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes are needed.

Now, let's think about how many large cakes we can make in 3 hours:

2 large cakes per hour x 3 hours = 6 large cakes

So, we need 20 - 6 = 14 large cakes.

Now, let's think about how many small cakes we can make in 3 hours:

35 small cakes per hour x 3 hours = 105 small cakes

So, we need 700 - 105 = 595 small cakes.

Now, we need to find out how many helpers we need to make both large and small cakes. We can do this by dividing the total number of cakes by the number of cakes each helper can make per hour:

14 large cakes + 595 small cakes = 619 cakes

619 cakes / 2 large cakes per helper per hour = 309 helpers

619 cakes / 35 small cakes per helper per hour = 18 helpers

So, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.

From the first statement, we know that two rolls have the same amount of falafel as six pita breads. So, the amount of falafel in one roll is equal to the amount of falafel in six pita breads.

From the second statement, we know that five baguettes have the same amount of falafel as three rolls. So, the amount of falafel in one baguette is equal to the amount of falafel in three rolls.

Now, we can set up a proportion to compare the amount of falafel in one pita bread to the amount of falafel in one baguette:

Let x be the amount of falafel in one pita bread.
Let y be the amount of falafel in one baguette.

We know that two rolls have the same amount of falafel as six pita breads, so we can write:

2x = 6y

We also know that three rolls have the same amount of falafel as five baguettes, so we can write:

3x = 5y

Now we can solve the system of equations:

2x = 6y
3x = 5y

Solving for x, we get:

x = 2y

So, the answer is:

The answer is 2y.

By what percentage must he increase the price to original ?
Answer Choices:
A) 21 %
B) 20 %
C) 25 %
D) 33 %
E) 18 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, the shopkeeper initially sold the items at a 20% discount, which means he sold them for 80% of the original price.

To find out by what percentage he must increase the price to original, we need to find the percentage increase needed to recover the 20% discount.

Let's use the formula for percentage increase:

Percentage increase = (new price - original price) / original price

In this case, the new price is 80% of the original price, so we can substitute that in:

Percentage increase = (80% - 100%) / 100%

Simplifying, we get:

Percentage increase = (80% - 100%) / 100%
= (20% - 100%) / 100%
= -20% / 100%
= -20%

So, to recover the 20% discount, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 20%.

The answer is:

C) 88
D) 66
E) 54
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem:

1. The bus fare for two persons for traveling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare for one person.
2. The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train between the two places is Rs. 1512.

Now, let's use this information to find the train fare for one person. We know that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so we can start by finding the train fare for one person and then multiplying it by 2 to get the bus fare for two persons.

Let's assume that the train fare for one person is x. Then, the bus fare for two persons is 4/3x.

We know that the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is Rs. 1512. So, we can set up the following equation:

4/3x + 8x = 1512

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x + 8x = 1512

12x = 1512

x = 126

So, the train fare for one person is Rs. 126.

E) ( 13 x - 12) / 24
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have a straight picket fence composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

We know that the total length of the fence is 13x/2, since each picket is 1/2 inch wide and there are 13 of them.

Now, we need to subtract the space between each pair of pickets, which is 6 inches. So, we can subtract 6 from 13x/2 to get:

13x/2 - 6

This gives us the length of the fence in feet:

13x/2 - 6 = x/2 - 3

Now, we can simplify this expression by dividing both sides by 2 to get:

x/2 - 3 = x/4 - 3

Simplifying further, we get:

x/4 - 3 = x/4 - 3

So, the length of the fence in feet is:

x/4

The answer is:

C) 13x/24

Therefore, the length of the fence in feet is 13x/24.",E

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned, so we know that 300 deer had tags during that year.
2. In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and 20 of them had tags from the previous year. This means that 20/500, or 4% of the deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year.
3. We are told that the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags. This means that the percentage of deer with tags in the entire forest is the same as the percentage of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample.
4. Therefore, if 4% of the deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year, we can assume that 4% of the total deer population in the forest had tags in both years.
5. We know that 300 deer had tags in 2001, so if 4% of the total deer population had tags in both years, then the total deer population in the forest is:

Scenario 1: The man catches the first train on the main line (5:00 AM). This happens if the man arrives at the station just in time to catch the train, and the harbor line train does not arrive before the main line train.

Scenario 2: The man catches the first train on the harbor line (5:02 AM). This happens if the man arrives at the station a little late, and the harbor line train arrives before the main line train.

We can calculate the probability of each scenario as follows:

Scenario 1: The probability of catching the first train on the main line is 1/2 (50%), since there is only one main line train in the hour.

Scenario 2: The probability of catching the first train on the harbor line is 1/2 (50%), since there is only one harbor line train in the hour.

Now, we need to find the probability of the man catching the first train. We can do this by adding the probabilities of Scenarios 1 and 2:

Probability of catching the first train = Scenario 1 + Scenario 2
= 0.5 + 0.5
= 1

So, the answer is A) 0.9. The man has a 90% probability of catching the first train.",B

B) 40 %
C) 50 %
D) 65 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.
2. If the projection comes true, the population two years from now will be exactly double the population of one year ago.

Now, let's assume the population of Boomtown one year ago was x. Then, the population two years ago was x - 1.

3. The population two years from now is 2x.

So, we can set up the equation:

2x = x + (10% of x) + (10% of x - 1)

Simplifying the equation:

2x = x + x + 10% of x - 10% of x

2x = 3x + 10% of x

Solving for x:

2x = 3x + 10% of x

x = 3x / 2 + 10% of x / 2

x = (3x + 10% of x) / 2

Now, we can see that the population of Boomtown over the last year has increased by 10% of x, which is equal to 10% of the current population.

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 50%.

The population of Boomtown over the last year has increased by 50% of the current population, which is 50% of x.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun.
2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal.

Now, let's assume that Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars. We can start with the first condition:

1. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, so Sajal's new amount will be 2x.

Now, let's apply the second condition:

2. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal, so Arjun's new amount will be 3y.

Now we have two equations:

2x = 3y ... (1)

We know that x and y are the amounts of money that Arjun and Sajal have, respectively. We can solve for x and y by substituting equation (1) into the other equation:

3y = 2x ... (2)

Now, we can solve for x and y:

x = 3y / 2 ... (3)

y = 2x / 3 ... (4)

Now we have the values of x and y:

x = 3y / 2
y = 2x / 3

The answer is:

The answer is C) 34, 62.

Explanation:

Arjun has $34 and Sajal has $62. If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, so Sajal will have $62. If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal, so Arjun will have $62.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, which means that both numbers must be divisible by 11.

We also know that the least common multiple (LCM) of two positive integers is the product of the two numbers, so we can write:

LCM(a, b) = ab

Since the LCM of 350 and x is 7700, we can set up the equation:

350x = 7700

Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by 11 to find the other integer:

350x / 11 = 7700 / 11

x = 7700 / 11

x = 700

So, the other integer is 700.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

So, we have a square piece of cloth that is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece. The area of each of the two triangles that are formed is 70 square feet.

We know that the area of a triangle is half the base times the height. So, if we call the length of the base of each triangle ""b"" and the height ""h"", then the area of each triangle is:

Area = (1/2)bh

Since there are two triangles, we need to double the area of each triangle to find the total area of the two triangles:

Total Area = 2(1/2)bh

Total Area = 2bh

We are given that the total area of the two triangles is 70 square feet, so we can set up the equation:

2bh = 70

Now, we can solve for ""b"" and ""h"":

b = 70/2
b = 35

h = 70/2b
h = 70/35
h = 2

Now that we have the values of ""b"" and ""h"", we can find the perimeter of the original square cloth:

Perimeter = 2(l + w)

where l is the length of the side of the square cloth and w is the width.

Since the square cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the length of the side of the original square cloth is:

l = 4 + 4
l = 8

The width of the original square cloth is half the length:

w = l/2
w = 8/2
w = 4

Now we can find the perimeter of the original square cloth:

Perimeter = 2(8 + 4)
Perimeter = 2(12)
Perimeter = 24

B) 30
C) 6
D) 15
E) 12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm, and it was reduced in the ratio 5:3. This means that for every 5 units of length that were removed, 3 units were also removed.

To find the new length of the ribbon, we can start with the original length of 30 cm and subtract the amount that was removed in the ratio of 5:3.

5 units of length were removed for every 3 units of length that were removed, so for every 5 units of length that were removed, the ribbon lost 3 units of length. Since there were 5 units of length that were removed, the ribbon lost 3 x 5 = 15 units of length.

Therefore, the new length of the ribbon is 30 - 15 = 15 cm.

Answer Choices:
A) 20
B) 30
C) 40
D) 200
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

From the problem statement, we know that:

M = abc is a three-digit number
N = cba
M > N
M - N + 396c = 990

We can start by analyzing the first two conditions:

1. M is a three-digit number, so it can take any value from 100 to 999.
2. N is a three-digit number as well, so it can take any value from 100 to 999.

Now, let's look at the third condition:

M - N + 396c = 990

We can simplify this equation by subtracting N from both sides:

M - N = 990 - N

Since M > N, we know that M - N is positive. Therefore, we can add 396c to both sides of the equation:

M - N + 396c = (990 - N) + 396c

Simplifying, we get:

M = 990 - N + 396c

Now, we can see that the value of M is greater than or equal to 990 - N, which means that M can take any value greater than or equal to 990 - N.

To find the maximum value of M, we need to find the maximum value of 990 - N. Since N is a three-digit number, we know that 990 - N will always be a two-digit number. Therefore, the maximum value of 990 - N is 990 - 999 = -99.

So, the maximum value of M is:

M = 990 - N + 396c
= 990 - 999 + 396c
= -99 + 396c

Since c is a single digit number, we know that 396c can take any value from 0 to 9. Therefore, the maximum value of M is:

M = -99 + 396c
= -99 + 396(",A

D) 700
E) none of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of students in the school.

We know that 20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 20% of x, which is 0.2x.

Similarly, 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 28% of x, which is 0.28x.

We also know that the total number of students is x.

Now, we can set up two equations:

0.2x + 0.28x = x (since the total number of students is x)

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

0.48x = x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 560

So, the answer is C) 600.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say Raj's age 5 years ago was x. Then, we can write:

Raj's age now = x + 5

We know that Raj is one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago, so we can write:

Raj's age 5 years ago = Rahim's age 5 years ago / 3

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

Raj's age 5 years ago = Rahim's age 5 years ago / 3
= (17 / 3) x 5
= 5 x 5
= 25

So, Raj was 25 years old 5 years ago.

Now, we can find Rahim's age now by subtracting Raj's age 5 years ago from his current age:

Rahim's age now = 17 - 25
= 17 - 5
= 12

E) 91 days
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The field is circular, and the cow is tethered in the middle. So, the distance from the cow to the edge of the field is the same as the distance from the cow to the center of the field.

The length of the rope is 14 feet, and the cow grazes 10 square feet per day. So, the distance the cow can graze in one day is:

10 square feet / 14 feet (rope length) = 0.714 (approximately)

Now, we need to convert this to days:

0.714 (approximately) x 365 (days in a year) = 257.69 (approximately)

So, the answer is:

2. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.
3. The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.

Now, let's think about how many papers the hotel orders on each day of the week:

Sunday: Hotel orders twice as many papers as it does on other days, so it orders 2 x 1 = 2 papers on Sunday.

Monday: The hotel orders 1 paper on Monday, since it's not Sunday.

Tuesday: The hotel orders 1 paper on Tuesday, since it's not Sunday.

Wednesday: The hotel orders 1 paper on Wednesday, since it's not Sunday.

Thursday: The hotel orders 1 paper on Thursday, since it's not Sunday.

Friday: The hotel orders 1 paper on Friday, since it's not Sunday.

Saturday: The hotel orders 1 paper on Saturday, since it's not Sunday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of papers the hotel orders per week:

Sunday: 2 papers x $4 each = $8
Monday: 1 paper x $1 = $1
Tuesday: 1 paper x $1 = $1
Wednesday: 1 paper x $1 = $1
Thursday: 1 paper x $1 = $1
Friday: 1 paper x $1 = $1

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let x be the number of friends who attended the picnic.

We know that the total cost of eatables was Rs 96, so the cost per person was Rs 96/x.

We also know that four friends did not show up, so the number of friends who did not show up is 4.

Since the remaining friends had to contribute Rs 4 extra each, the total cost for the remaining friends is:

Rs 96/x + 4(x-4)

We want to find the value of x, so we can solve for x in the above equation.

First, let's simplify the equation:

Rs 96/x + 4(x-4) = Rs 96/x + 4x - 16

Now, we can see that the equation is a linear equation with a constant term and a linear term. We can solve this equation by subtracting Rs 4 from both sides:

Rs 96/x + 4x - 16 - 4 = 0

Now, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:

(Rs 96/x) + 4x - 16 = 0

We know that Rs 96/x is a constant, so we can factor it out:

4x - 16 = 0

Solving for x, we get:

x = 16

So, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

The area of the rectangle is given as 27 cm x 17 cm = 469 cm^2.

To form a square, we need to make sure that the length of each side is equal to the length of the rectangle. So, we can set up the equation:

Length of side = 27 cm / 4 (since there are 4 sides in a square)

Simplifying, we get:

Length of side = 27 cm / 4 = 6.75 cm

Since we cannot have a fractional side length, we round up to the nearest whole number:

Length of side = 7 cm

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) Rs 400
B) Rs 500
C) Rs 600
D) Rs 700
E) Rs 800
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let x be the amount each nephew receives. Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, the amount each daughter receives is 4x.

We know that the total amount the man has to distribute is Rs 8600. Let's distribute it among the sons, nephews, and daughters:

Sons: 5 sons x Rs 5 (since each son receives five times as much as each nephew) = Rs 25 per son x 5 sons = Rs 125

Nephews: 2 nephews x Rs 4x (since each nephew receives four times as much as each daughter) = Rs 4x per nephew x 2 nephews = Rs 8x

Daughters: 4 daughters x Rs 4x (since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew) = Rs 4x per daughter x 4 daughters = Rs 16x

Total amount distributed: Rs 125 + Rs 8x + Rs 16x = Rs 8600

Now we can solve for x:

Rs 8600 = Rs 125 + Rs 8x + Rs 16x

Subtracting Rs 125 from both sides gives us:

Rs 7350 = Rs 8x + Rs 16x

Adding Rs 8x and Rs 16x gives us:

Rs 7350 = Rs 24x

Dividing both sides by 24 gives us:

x = Rs 300

So, each nephew receives Rs 300, and each daughter receives four times as much, or Rs 1200.

Meenu replied, ""I won't reveal my weight directly as I am overweight.""

But she said, ""I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight.""

Now, let's think about what Meenu's weight could be. Since she is overweight, she might not want to reveal her exact weight directly. So, she gives a hint by saying that she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight.

Let's assume Meenu's weight is x Kgs. Then, we can write the equation:

29 + (x/2) = Meenu's weight

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x = 29 + (x/2)

x = 29 + x/2

Solving for x, we get:

x = 58

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

E) 27
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let the youngest member's age be x. Then, the next member's age would be x + 3, and the next one after that would be x + 6, and so on.

We know that the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + 2(7-1)) = 250

Since there are 7 members in total, we can write:

x + x + 3 + x + 6 + ... + x + 2(7-1) = 250

Combine like terms:

2x + 18 = 250

Subtract 18 from both sides:

2x = 232

Divide both sides by 2:

x = 116

So, the youngest member is 7 years old, and the next member is 116 + 3 = 119 years old, and so on.

There are a total of 7 members in the club, and their ages are 7, 119, 122, 125, 128, 131, and 134.

D) 2 pm on the next day
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am, so it covers a distance of 540 km (72 km/hour x 7 hours) in 7 hours.
2. Train B leaves Mumbai Central at 2 pm, so it covers the same distance of 540 km in 5 hours (since it runs at a higher speed of 72 km/hour).
3. To find the time at which the two trains meet, we need to find the time when Train B catches up with Train A.
4. Since Train B covers the same distance in less time, it will catch up with Train A at a point where Train A has been running for the same amount of time as Train B has been running.
5. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Time taken by Train A = Time taken by Train B

11 am + (540/40) = 2 pm + (540/72)

Solving for the time, we get:

540/40 = 13.5 hours
540/72 = 7.5 hours

Therefore, Train A will meet Train B at:

11 am + 13.5 hours = 5 pm

So, the answer is C) 5 pm on the next day.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

So, Mark tells John that if he gives him half of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that Mark's money is twice the amount that John has.

Next, John says that if he gives Mark one-third of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that John's money is three times the amount that Mark has.

Now, we can set up an equation based on these two statements:

Mark's money = 2 x John's money
John's money = 3 x Mark's money

We know that Mark's money is Rs. 75, so we can substitute that into the equation:

2 x John's money = Rs. 75

Now, we can solve for John's money:

John's money = Rs. 75 / 2

John's money = Rs. 37.50

After another two days, the number of water lilies will double again, so there will be 128 x 2 = 256 water lilies on the lake.

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days.

We want to find out how much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days.

We know that x and y are different numbers of men, and x and y are also different numbers of hours per day.

Let's assume that the work is done at the same rate per hour, so the rate of work is the same for both x and y men.

Since x men can do x units of work in x days, the rate of work is x units per day.

Now, if y men work for y days, they will also do y units of work.

So, the total work done by x and y men together is:

x units + y units = (x + y) units

Since x and y are different, x + y is not equal to x or y.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) x 3 / y 2 units.

Explanation:

We can see that the rate of work is the same for both x and y men, so the work done by x men in x days is the same as the work done by y men in y days.

Therefore, the total work done by x and y men together is:

x units + y units = (x + y) units

Since x and y are different, x + y is not equal to x or y.

So, the answer is C) x 3 / y 2 units, which is the ratio of the number of units done by x men in x days to the number of units done by y men in y days.",B

* If we choose A and B as two of our points, we can choose any two other points from C, D, and E to form a quadrilateral. There are 3 x 3 = 9 possible choices for the other two points.
* If we choose C and D as two of our points, we can choose any two other points from A, B, E to form a quadrilateral. There are 2 x 2 = 4 possible choices for the other two points.
* If we choose D and E as two of our points, we can choose any two other points from A, B, C to form a quadrilateral. There are 2 x 2 = 4 possible choices for the other two points.
* If we choose E and F as two of our points, we can choose any two other points from A, B, C, D to form a quadrilateral. There are 4 x 2 = 8 possible choices for the other two points.

Adding up all these possibilities, we get:

9 + 4 + 4 + 8 = 25

Answer Choices:

B) 130 °
C) 140 °
D) 160 °
E) 220 °
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by looking at the diagram:

In this diagram, we can see that:

* Angle A is 160°, since it is half of the minor arc AC.
* Angle B is 150°, since it is half of the minor arc BD.

Now, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a semicircle is 180° to find the measure of angle AD:

Angle AD + Angle B + Angle C = 180°

We know that Angle B is 150°, so we can set up the equation:

Angle AD + 150° + Angle C = 180°

We also know that Angle C is 160°, so we can substitute that in:

Angle AD + 150° + 160° = 180°

Now we can simplify the equation:

Angle AD + 150° + 160° = 180°

Angle AD = 180° - 150° - 160°

Angle AD = 180° - 310°

Angle AD = 170°

So, the measure of minor arc AD is 170°.

A) 26
B) 28
C) 21
D) 80
E) 23
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by identifying the formula for the area of a trapezium:

Area = (b1 + b2) \* h

where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides (the widths at the top and bottom) and h is the height (the depth of the canal).

We know that the area of the cross-section is 640 square meters, so we can set up the equation:

640 = (10 + b2) \* h

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

640 = (10 + 6) \* h

Simplifying:

640 = 16 \* h

Dividing both sides by 16:

h = 40

So, the depth of the canal is 40 meters.

D) 3000 pi
E) 7500 pi
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan.
2. The fan rotates at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute.
3. We need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds.

Now, let's convert the rate of rotation from revolutions per minute to revolutions per second:

300 revolutions/minute x (1 revolution/minute) / (1000 seconds/minute) = 300 revolutions/second

Now, we can use the formula for the distance traveled by a point on a circular path to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade:

distance = (revolutions x radius) / 2

In this case, the radius of the fan blade is half of the diameter, which is 10 centimeters.

distance = (300 revolutions x 10 cm) / 2

Now, we can simplify and solve for the distance traveled:

distance = 300 x 10 / 2

distance = 600 cm

Therefore, the answer is:

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds is 600 centimeters.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have the equation:

x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16)/(n + 4√n + 4)

First, let's simplify the expression:

x = (n^2 + 2n + 16)/(n + 4)

Now, we can see that the numerator is always greater than or equal to n^2, since 2√n is less than or equal to n. So, we can bound the numerator as follows:

n^2 + 2n + 16 ≤ n^2 + 2n + 20

Now, we can simplify the denominator:

n + 4 ≤ n + 4√n + 4

Since n is between 36 and 72, we know that n + 4 is between 40 and 74. Therefore, we can bound the denominator as follows:

n + 4 ≤ 74

Now, we can substitute these bounds into the numerator and denominator:

x = (n^2 + 2n + 16)/(n + 4) ≤ (n^2 + 2n + 20)/74

Simplifying, we get:

x ≤ 20/74

x ≤ 27/74

x ≤ 28

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. A starts the business with Rs. 40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs. 60,000.
3. C joins them after some more time (we don't know when).
4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs. 375,000.
5. C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share.

Now, let's think about the profit distribution:

Profit = Rs. 375,000

A's share = (40,000 + 60,000) x 12 = Rs. 240,000 (for 2 months)

B's share = Rs. 60,000 x 12 = Rs. 720,000 (for 2 months)

C's share = Rs. 120,000 x 12 = Rs. 1440,000 (for x months)

Now, we can set up an equation based on the given information:

A's share + B's share + C's share = Total Profit

240,000 + 720,000 + 1440,000 = 375,000

Solving the equation, we get:

240,000 + 720,000 + 1440,000 = 375,000

3 + 7 + 14 = 22

Now, we can find the number of months C joined the business:

22 - 2 (for A and B) = 20

Therefore, C joined the business 20 months after B joined.

The answer is B) 4 months.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The given paper is a square with side length 20 cm. Two semi-circles are drawn on the opposite sides as diameters.

Step 1: Draw a diameter from one corner of the square to the opposite corner.

The diameter will divide the square into two parts - a semi-circle and a rectangle.

Step 2: Cut down the semi-circles along the diameters.

The semi-circles will be cut into two parts - an arc and a sector.

Step 3: Find the area of the remaining paper.

The remaining paper is the rectangle that is left after cutting the semi-circles. The area of the rectangle can be found using the formula for the area of a rectangle:

Area = Length x Width

In this case, the length and width of the rectangle are both 20 cm, so the area of the remaining paper is:

Area = 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 400 cm^2.",C

D) M + 3 N / 8
E) M + N / 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's first consider the time taken for the athlete to run M miles. We know that the time taken is 4 hours, so the speed of the athlete is:

Speed = Distance / Time
= M / 4

Now, let's consider the time taken for the athlete to ride the bike N miles. We know that the time taken is also 4 hours, so the speed of the athlete on the bike is:

Speed = Distance / Time
= N / 4

Now, we need to find the average speed for both activities combined. We can do this by finding the sum of the speeds for both activities and dividing by 2:

Average Speed = (M / 4 + N / 4) / 2

Simplifying, we get:

Average Speed = (M + N) / 8

So, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The work can be completed in 6 days by 8 men, so the workload per day is:

Workload per day = 8 men x 1 day = 8 days of work

2. To complete the same work in half a day, we need to double the workload per day:

Workload per day = 2 x 8 days of work = 16 days of work

3. Since there are 8 men working for 6 days, there are a total of:

Total work done by 8 men in 6 days = 8 men x 6 days = 48 days of work

Answer Choices:
A) 180
B) 90
C) 270
D) 360
E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
2. He turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
3. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.

We can start by finding out how long it took Kevin to drive from A to B the first time. Since he drove at a constant speed of 70 mph, we can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

where distance is the distance between A and B, and time is the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B.

We know that Kevin drove for 3 hours before turning around, so we can set up the equation:

distance = 70 x 3

Solving for distance, we get:

distance = 210 miles

Now, we know that Kevin was 70 miles away from B when he turned around. So, the total distance he traveled the first time is:

total distance = distance + 70

total distance = 210 + 70

total distance = 280 miles

Since Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph on the return trip, we can use the same formula to find out how long it took him to drive back to A:

distance = speed x time

where distance is the distance between B and A, and time is the time it took Kevin to drive back to A.

We know that Kevin drove for 3 hours on the return trip, so we can set up the equation:

distance = 90 x 3

Solving for distance, we get:

distance = 270 miles

Therefore, the total distance Kevin traveled is:

total distance = 280 + 270

total distance = 550 miles

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the man rows at a rate of x kmph in still water.

When he rows against the current, his rate is 2 kmph less than his rate in still water, so his rate against the current is:

x - 2 kmph

Now, we know that the man's total distance traveled (including both the distance he rows against the current and the distance he rows in still water) is:

Distance = (x - 2) km + x km = 2x km

Since the man rows for a total distance of 2x km, and his rate in still water is x kmph, it takes him x/4 hours to row 2x km in still water.

Now, when he rows against the current, his rate is 2 kmph less than his rate in still water, so it takes him (x - 2)/4 hours to row the same distance.

Since the man rows for a total distance of 2x km, we can set up the following equation:

(x - 2)/4 = (x/4)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 12 kmph

So, the man's rate along the current is:

The answer is C) 12 kmph.",E

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17.
* The sum of the squares of its digits is 109.
* Subtracting 495 from the number gives a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order.

Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, so we know that the digits must be 1, 7, and 9 (since the sum of any three digits is always a multiple of 3, and 17 is a multiple of 3).
2. The sum of the squares of its digits is 109, so we know that the digits must be 1, 2, and 9 (since the sum of any two digits is always a multiple of 2, and 109 is a multiple of 2).
3. Subtracting 495 from the number gives a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order. This means that the original number must be a multiple of 495.

Now, let's try to find the original number. We know that the digits are 1, 7, and 9, so we can try different combinations of these digits to see if they satisfy the given conditions.

1. 179: This number has a sum of digits of 17, but its sum of squares of digits is 299, which is not equal to 109.
2. 719: This number has a sum of digits of 17, and its sum of squares of digits is 299, which is not equal to 109.
3. 917: This number has a sum of digits of 17, and its sum of squares of digits is 299, which is not equal to 109.

None of these combinations work, so we need to try other combinations.

1. 197: This number has a sum of digits of 17, and its sum of squares of digits is 109. However, subtracting 495 from this number does not give a number consisting of the same digits written",A

D) 59 : 91
E) 69 : 101
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the problem.

We know that alloy X is made of 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper, so the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9.

Similarly, we know that alloy Y is made of 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper, so the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11.

When we mix 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, we have a total of 100 grams of the mixture (40 + 60 = 100).

Since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, the number of grams of zinc in alloy X is 6 x 40 = 240 grams, and the number of grams of copper in alloy X is 9 x 40 = 360 grams.

Similarly, since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, the number of grams of zinc in alloy Y is 7 x 60 = 420 grams, and the number of grams of copper in alloy Y is 11 x 60 = 660 grams.

When we mix the two alloys, we have a total of 240 + 420 = 660 grams of zinc and 360 + 660 = 1020 grams of copper.

So, the ratio of zinc to copper in the mixture (alloy Z) is:

660 / 1020 = 11 / 17

B) 20
C) 22
D) 24
E) 26
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze this problem step by step:

1. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to the bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes $4,000.
2. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators.

Since Hoopsmot contributes more than twice as much as Smolapon, we can assume that Hoopsmot's contribution is the majority of the bribery pool. Let's say Hoopsmot's contribution influences x senators, and Smolapon's contribution influences y senators, where x + y = 30 (since they have a total of 30 senators they can influence).

We know that Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 and Smolapon contributes $4,000, so the total amount of money they have is:

$16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000

Since Hoopsmot's contribution is the majority of the bribery pool, we can assume that the number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot is at least half of the total number of senators they can influence:

x ≥ (20,000 / 2) = 10

Since x is an integer, we can round up to the nearest integer:

x = 11

Now we can calculate y:

y = 30 - x = 30 - 11 = 19

So, Hoopsmot influences 11 senators, and Smolapon influences 19 senators.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given: The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, and the sum of the numbers is 1000.

We know that the squares of two numbers can be written as:

x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2

So, we can rewrite the given information as:

x^2 + y^2 = 256000

x + y = 1000

Now, we can solve for x and y.

First, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation to isolate y:

x^2 + y^2 - x = 256000 - x

y^2 = 256000 - x - x

y^2 = 256000 - 2x

Now, we can take the square root of both sides to find y:

y = ±√(256000 - 2x)

Simplifying, we get:

y = ±√(512000 - 2x)

Now, we can substitute the value of y into one of the original equations to find x:

x + y = 1000

x + ±√(512000 - 2x) = 1000

Solving for x, we get:

x = 628

So, the answer is B) 628.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say there are x employees in the organization.

We know that the total contribution collected by the organization is Rs. 6 lakh.

Each employee contributed Rs. 60 extra, so the total contribution from each employee is Rs. 60 + Rs. 6 lakh = Rs. 60 + Rs. 6,000,000 = Rs. 6,060,000.

The total contribution from all employees is Rs. 6,060,000.

We are asked to find out how many employees there are in the organization.

So, we can set up the equation:

x x Rs. 60 = Rs. 6,060,000

x = ?

Now, we can solve for x.

x = Rs. 6,060,000 / Rs. 60

x = 100

The answer is C) 400.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 20% of the voters are not eligible to vote, so we need to subtract that from the total number of voters.

20% of 5,000 = 20/100 x 5,000 = 1,000

So, the total number of eligible voters is:

5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000

2. Next, we know that the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.

15% of 4,000 = 15/100 x 4,000 = 600

So, the total number of votes the winning candidate received is:

4,000 + 600 = 4,600

E) 600 meters
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time, so they have the same initial distance.
2. Ram travels at a speed of 20 m/s, and Krishna travels at a speed of 40 m/s.
3. They travel in the same direction along the same route, so they are moving towards each other.
4. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds.

Now, let's think about the distance traveled by Ram and Krishna:

Ram travels for 10 seconds at a speed of 20 m/s, so he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 20 m/s x 10 s
= 200 m

Krishna travels for 10 seconds at a speed of 40 m/s, so he covers a distance of:

Distance = Speed x Time
= 40 m/s x 10 s
= 400 m

Since they meet at point C, the total distance between A and B is the sum of the distances traveled by Ram and Krishna:

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's first calculate the speed of car X:

Distance covered by car Y = 415 km
Time taken by car Y = 5 hours
Speed of car Y = Distance / Time
= 415 km / 5 hours
= 83 km/hr

Now, we need to find the difference in the speed of the two cars.

The difference in the speed of the two cars = Speed of car Y - Speed of car X
= 83 km/hr - 40 km/hr
= 43 km/hr

Answer Choices:
A) 80
B) 120
C) 240
D) 320
E) 360
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

Let's start with the information that the store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. We know that 80% of the inventory was sold, which means that 80% of 600 is 480 (600 x 0.8).

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold. So, if we let x be the number of yellow golf balls sold, then the number of white golf balls sold is also x.

We know that the total number of golf balls sold is 480, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 480

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x = 480

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 240

So, the store had 240 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given:

* The flagstaff is 17.5 meters high.
* The shadow of the flagstaff is 40.25 meters long.

We know that the ratio of the height of the flagstaff to its shadow is the same as the ratio of the height of the building to its shadow. In other words, if the height of the flagstaff is x meters, then the shadow of the flagstaff is x \* 40.25 meters long.

We are asked to find the height of the building.

So, we can set up an equation:

x \* 40.25 = 28.75

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 28.75 / 40.25

x = 7/8

x = 0.875

So, the height of the building is 0.875 \* 17.5 meters = 15 meters.

C) 6 hours
D) 4 hours
E) 7 hours
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the distance between the cars at time t is x miles. Since they are traveling at the same direction, the distance between them is constant.

The rate of the first car is 55 mph, so the distance traveled by the first car in one hour is 55 miles.

The rate of the second car is 52 mph, so the distance traveled by the second car in one hour is 52 miles.

Since they started at the same time, the distance between them at time t is equal to the distance traveled by the first car minus the distance traveled by the second car.

So, we can set up the equation:

x - 55 + 52 = 15

Simplifying the equation:

x = 40

So, the cars will be 15 miles away from each other after 4 hours.

Answer Choices:
A) 50 %
B) 60 %
C) 55 %
D) 70 %
E) 58 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

First, we know that the merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, so the cost per kg is:

Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5 per kg

Next, we know that the merchant sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg, so the revenue generated is:

90 kg x Rs. 7.50 per kg = Rs. 675

Now, we can calculate the percentage gain as follows:

(Revenue - Cost) / Cost x 100

= (Rs. 675 - Rs. 5 per kg x 90 kg) / Rs. 5 per kg x 90 kg

= (Rs. 675 - Rs. 450) / Rs. 450 x 90

= 50%

So, the answer is:

At what time do the 2 trains cross one another ?
Answer Choices:
A) 1 hr 23 min
B) 1 hr 15 min
C) 1 hr 8 min
D) 56 min
E) 55 min
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the situation:

1. Train M leaves City A at 5 am, so it takes 4 hours to reach City B (9 am - 5 am = 4 hours).
2. Train N leaves City B at 7 am, so it takes 3 hours to reach City A (10:30 am - 7 am = 3 hours).
3. Since both trains are traveling in opposite directions, they will meet at a point on the track.

Now, we need to find the point where the two trains cross each other. We know that Train M takes 4 hours to reach City B, and Train N takes 3 hours to reach City A, so the point of crossing must be halfway between the two cities.

Let's use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance between the two cities, r is the rate (speed) of the train, and t is the time. Since both trains are traveling at constant speeds, we can use the average speed of the two trains to find the distance between the two cities.

The average speed of Train M is (4 hours / 5 am - 9 am) = 4 / 4 hours = 1 hour.
The average speed of Train N is (3 hours / 7 am - 10:30 am) = 3 / 3 hours = 1 hour.

Now, we can use the formula d = rt to find the distance between the two cities:

d = rt = (1 hour) x (4 hours) = 4 hours

Since the distance between the two cities is 4 hours, the point of crossing must be halfway between the two cities, which is 2 hours from both cities.

The answer is A) 1 hour 23 minutes, since the point of crossing is 23 minutes after the hour mark (1 hour + 23 minutes).</s>",D

Given:

* The first ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that is 10 inches long.
* The second ant is 6 inches tall.

We need to find the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.

Let's start by using the information that the first ant's shadow is 10 inches long. We know that the shadow is 10 inches long because the ant is 4 inches tall, so the shadow is 10 - 4 = 6 inches longer than the ant.

Now, we need to find the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts. Since the taller ant is 6 inches tall, its shadow will be 6 + 6 = 12 inches longer than the ant.

Therefore, the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts is 12 inches.

The answer is:

C) 4 m
D) 4.2 m
E) 4.4 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* The height of the room is 2.5 times the semi-perimeter
* The area of the walls is 15 sq m
* The width of the paper is 50 cm
* The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260

We can start by finding the length of the walls. Since the area of the walls is 15 sq m, and the width of the paper is 50 cm, the length of the walls must be:

15 sq m / (50 cm x 2) = 15 sq m / 100 cm = 150 cm

Now, we can find the height of the room by multiplying the length of the walls by the height-to-semi-perimeter ratio:

Height = (150 cm x 2.5) cm

Simplifying, we get:

Height = 375 cm

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 4 m

Note that the other answer choices are not correct because they do not satisfy the given constraints.

The sum of k consecutive integers is 51.

We know that the least integer is -50, so we can start by adding -50 to the sum:

In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand ?
Answer Choices:
A) 10 / 7
B) 20 / 7
C) 30 / 7
D) 40 / 7
E) 50 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say we have 10 kg of the mixture, and it contains 30% sand and 70% clay. This means that the amount of sand in the mixture is:

30% of 10 kg = 3 kg

And the amount of clay in the mixture is:

70% of 10 kg = 7 kg

Now, we want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand. This means we need to remove some of the clay and replace it with sand.

Let's think about how much we need to remove. If we want the mixture to contain equal quantities of clay and sand, then we need to remove half of the clay. This is because the current amount of clay is twice the amount of sand, so removing half of the clay will make the amounts of clay and sand equal.

So, we need to remove half of 7 kg, which is:

7 kg / 2 = 3.5 kg

Now, we need to replace the removed clay with sand. We can do this by adding the same amount of sand that we removed from the clay. So, we need to add:

3.5 kg of sand

To the mixture.

Now, let's calculate the new amount of clay and sand in the mixture:

New amount of clay = Original amount of clay - Amount removed
= 7 kg - 3.5 kg
= 3.5 kg

New amount of sand = Original amount of sand + Amount added
= 3 kg + 3.5 kg
= 6.5 kg

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 6.5 kg of sand and 3.5 kg of clay.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let the man's original income be x.

We know that he spends 70% of his income, so his expenditure is 70% of x, or 0.7x.

If his income increases by 20%, then his new income is 1.2x (1 + 0.20).

We can set up an equation to represent the situation:

0.7x + 0.7(1.2x) = x + 0.7(1.2x)

Simplifying the equation:

0.7x + 0.7x + 0.42x = x + 0.7x + 0.42x

Combine like terms:

1.42x = 1.42x

Now we can see that the equation is true for any value of x.

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 63.5%.

The man's new expenditure will be 63.5% of his new income, which is 1.2x.",A

Answer Choices:
A) 4
B) 7
C) 10
D) 14
E) 21
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's start by considering the number of ways we can choose the 98 red tulips. We can choose 98 flowers in 98! = 98 × 97 × 96 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 98! ways.

Now, for each way we choose the 98 red tulips, we can choose the 28 white tulips in 28! = 28 × 27 × 26 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 28! ways.

Since the number of red tulips and the number of white tulips are the same in each bouquet, we need to divide the total number of ways by the number of ways we can choose the red tulips.

So, the total number of bouquets we can make is:

98! / 28! = 98 × 27 × 26 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 / 28 × 27 × 26 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1

Simplifying this expression, we get:

98! / 28! = 98 × 27 × 26 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 / 28 × 27 × 26 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 98 × 27 × 26 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 / 28

Since the numerator and denominator are both divisible by 28, we can simplify the fraction further:

98 × 27 × 26 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 / 28 = 98 × 27 × 26 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 / 28 × 28

Now, we can see that the numerator and denominator are both equal to 28, so the fraction simplifies to:

28 × 28 = 784

Therefore, the answer is:

2. The recorded property worth is a greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65 and is divisible by 100.

Now, let's find the recorded property worth:

Since the recorded property worth is a greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65, it must be $1000 (the closest even integer less than or equal to $1023.65).

And, since the recorded property worth is divisible by 100, it must be a multiple of 100.

So, the recorded property worth is $1000.

C) 10 Trousers
D) 7 Trousers
E) 11 Trousers
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's first calculate the total amount the man spends on shirts:

30 x (number of shirts) = 810 - 70 x (number of trouser)

Since the man spends 810 on both trouser and shirts, we can set up the equation:

30x + 70y = 810

where x is the number of shirts and y is the number of trouser.

Now, we can solve for x and y:

30x + 70y = 810

x + 70y = 810

x = 810 - 70y

To find the maximum number of trouser, we can set y = 11 (the maximum number of trouser):

x + 70(11) = 810

x + 770 = 810

x = 810 - 770

x = 40

So, the man can buy 40 shirts and 11 trouser.

We know that the subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00 and represents a saving of 25% of the cover price. This means that the cover price per issue is 75% of the subscription cost.

So, we can set up the following equation:

Cover price per issue = (Subscription cost x 75%) / 15

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:

Cover price per issue = ($42.00 x 75%) / 15

Since they meet for the second time, Bob covers a distance of 48 km more than Allen. So, we can set up the equation:

XY + YX = 48 km

Simplifying the equation:

2XY = 48 km

Dividing both sides by 2:

XY = 24 km

Now we know that the distance between X and Y is 24 km.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given information:

The cost of new tires is $180 per tire, and the cost of repairing current tires is $40 per tire.

The new tires last for 4 years, so the annual cost of new tires is:

$180 / 4 years = $45 per year

The current tires last for 1 additional year after repair, so the annual cost of repairing current tires is:

$40 / 1 year = $40 per year

Now, we can calculate the percentage difference between the annual costs of new tires and repairing current tires:

($45 - $40) / $40 = 12.5%

So, the answer is C) 12.5%. The annual cost of new tires is 12.5% greater than the cost of repairing current tires.</s>The answer is C) 12.5%.",C

So, we know that the total length of the rope is 20 meters, and one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the other. This means that the length of the shorter piece of rope is 20 - 3 = 17 meters.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Length of longer piece = Length of shorter piece + 3

We know that the length of the shorter piece is 17 meters, so we can substitute that value into the equation:

Length of longer piece = 17 + 3

Simplifying, we get:

Length of longer piece = 17 + 3
= 20

So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 20 meters.

D) $ 202
E) $ 200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. This means that the interest rate is 6% per six months, or half of the annual rate.

To find the interest accrued at maturity, we need to calculate the interest for each six-month period and add them up. There are two six-month periods in a year, so we'll calculate the interest for each period and then add them up.

For the first six months, the interest is:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $5,000 x 6% x 1/2
= $300

For the second six months, the interest is:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= $5,000 x 6% x 1/2
= $300

Total interest = Interest for first six months + Interest for second six months
= $300 + $300
= $600

B) 25
C) 15
D) 20
E) 21
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say Sachin's age 10 years ago was x. Then, Sachin's current age is 2x.

We know that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years ago, so Ajay's age 10 years ago was half of Sachin's age, which is x/2.

Now, we know that Ajay's current age is x/2 + 10.

We are asked to find out how old Ajay will be in 10 years. So, we need to find out how old Ajay will be in 10 years from now, which is:

x/2 + 10 + 10 = x/2 + 20

Now, we know that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so:

x/2 + 20 = 40

Simplifying the equation:

x/2 = 20 - 20

x/2 = 0

x = 0

So, Ajay is currently 0 years old.

B) 1700
C) 3440
D) Can not be determined
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 340 meters.

The width of the plot is not given, so we'll call it x meters.

The area of the plot is given as 1 square meter.

So, the length of the plot is x meters.

The perimeter of the plot is given as 340 meters, so the sum of the lengths of all four sides must be 340:

x + x + x + x = 340

Since all four sides are the same length, we can simplify this equation:

4x = 340

Now, we can divide both sides by 4 to solve for x:

x = 85

So, the width of the plot is 85 meters.

Now, we need to find the area of the plot in square meters:

Area = length x width
= 85 x 85
= 7225 square meters

Now, we need to find the cost of gardening the boundary at a rate of 10 per square meter:

Cost = area x rate
= 7225 x 10
= 72,250

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels.
* The remaining revenue (100% - 34%) was from the sale of biographies.
* The company's revenue from the sale of biographies was 1/3 of the remaining revenue.

So, we can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the revenue from novels and biographies:

Revenue from novels (34% of total revenue) = x
Revenue from biographies (1/3 of remaining revenue) = x/3

We know that the total revenue of the company is 100%, so:

x + x/3 = 100

Simplifying the equation:

2x/3 = 100

x = 200

So, the answer is:

Since the bee bypasses 0.05% of the flowers it flies by, and there are 100% - 0.05% = 99.95% of flowers that the bee will visit. Therefore, the number of flowers the bee will visit is 99.95 x 100 = 9995.

Now, to bypass 8 flowers, the bee will fly by 9995 - 8 = 9987 flowers.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through each question:

a. 2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2 ( ? ) = ( a - b ) 2

We can start by simplifying the numerator and denominator of the fraction:

2 - b 2 / ( a + b ) 2 = ( a - b ) 2

Now we can see that the numerator and denominator are both perfect squares:

( a - b ) 2 = ( a - b ) ( a + b )

So we can rewrite the equation as:

( a - b ) 2 = a 2 - 2ab + b 2

Now we can see that the expression inside the parentheses is a perfect square:

a 2 - 2ab + b 2 = ( a + b ) 2

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) 60
B) 56
C) 51
D) 61
E) 41
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

We know that the number is as much greater than 36 as it is less than 86. This means that the difference between the number and 36 is equal to the difference between the number and 86.

So, we can set up two equations:

Equation 1:

Number - 36 = (Number - 86) / 2

Equation 2:

Number - 86 = (Number - 36) / 2

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously.

From Equation 1, we have:

Number - 36 = (Number - 86) / 2

Number - 36 = (Number - 86) / 2

Number - 36 = (Number - 86) / 2

Number = 86 + 36

Number = 122

From Equation 2, we have:

Number - 86 = (Number - 36) / 2

Number - 86 = (Number - 36) / 2

Number - 86 = (Number - 36) / 2

Number = 36 + 86

Number = 122

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 122.

Answer Choices:
A) 247.67
B) 237.67
C) 227.67
D) 215.67
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the invoice terms:

* 4/30 means the payment is due in 30 days.
* n/100 means the interest rate is 100 - n% of the principal.

So, if the merchant pays the full amount within 30 days, there will be no interest charged. However, if they miss the payment, they will be charged interest at an annual rate of 100 - n% on the principal amount of $20,000.

To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to find the highest value of n such that the interest rate is less than or equal to the discount offered (4/30).

We can do this by setting up an equation:

100 - n% = 4/30

To solve for n, we can divide both sides by 100:

n% = 4/30 x 100

n% = 400/30

n% = 13.33%

So, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 13.33%. The answer is:

The answer is C) 227.67.

Note that this is the highest interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money and still take advantage of the discount. If they borrow at a higher interest rate, they will not be able to take advantage of the discount.",A

Step 1: We can choose the first group of 5 customers in 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 ways.

Step 2: Now, we have 10 - 5 = 5 bottles left for the second group. We can choose the second group of 5 customers in 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120 ways.

Since we have two groups of 5 customers each, the total number of ways to create the two groups is 120 × 120 = 14400.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let's say the amount of wheat and corn in the mixture is 2x and 3x pounds, respectively, since the ratio of rice to wheat to corn is 2:3:5.

We know that the total weight of the mixture is 3 pounds, so we can set up the equation:

2x + 3x + 5x = 3

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 3x + 5x = 3

6x = 3

x = 3/6

x = 1/2

Now, we can find the amount of wheat and corn in the mixture:

Wheat: 2x = 2(1/2) = 1 pound

Corn: 3x = 3(1/2) = 1.5 pounds

Therefore, the answer is C) 7 pounds of corn.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The company produces 7200 pens, and 10% of them are defective, so the number of defective pens is 7200 x 0.1 = 720 pens.
2. The company delivers 7200 - 720 = 6480 pens to its wholesaler.
3. The company earns a profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens, so the total profit is 6480 x 0.25 = 1620.

So, we have two expressions, L(x,y) and R(x,y), and we want to find a contradiction between them.

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y]

R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

First, let's simplify the expressions:

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = x + y + x+y = 2x + 2y

R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2(x+y)

Now, we can see that L(x,y) and R(x,y) are equal if and only if 2x + 2y = 2(x+y).

Let's expand the left-hand side:

2x + 2y = 2(x+y)

Expanding the right-hand side:

2x + 2y = 2x + 2(y)

Now, we can see that the expressions are not equal, so the answer is B) L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y).

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given:

* The electric pole is 14 meters high.
* The shadow of the electric pole is 10 meters long.

We know that the height of the tree is not given directly, but we can use the information that the shadow of the tree is 15 meters long.

Let's assume that the height of the tree is x meters. Then, the shadow of the tree would be 15 - x meters long.

We can set up an equation based on the information given:

10 = (14 - x) + (15 - x)

Simplifying the equation:

10 = 14 - 2x + 15 - 2x

Combine like terms:

10 = -2x + 15

Solve for x:

x = 15/2

x = 7.5

So, the height of the tree is 7.5 meters.

* An orange costs 18 dollars.
* A pineapple costs 27 dollars.
* A grape costs 15 dollars.

We can see that the prices of the fruits increase as the fruit becomes more expensive. Specifically, the price of each fruit increases by 3 dollars from the previous fruit.

Using this pattern, we can predict the price of a mango as follows:

* Orange (18) + 3 = 21
* Pineapple (27) + 3 = 30
* Mango (21) + 3 = 24

Therefore, the answer is:

C) ( by − ay) / 2
D) ( ay + by) / x
E) ( a − b) / 2 y
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given information:

* The triangle has vertices at (a, 0), (b, 0), and (x, y).
* a > x > b > 0 > y.

We can start by finding the height of the triangle, which is the distance from the base (b) to the vertex (x, y). Since a > x > b, the height is:

height = x - b

Now, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:

area = (base × height) / 2

In this case, the base is b, and the height is x - b. So, the area is:

area = (b × (x - b)) / 2

Simplifying, we get:

area = (b × x) / 2 - b^2 / 2

Since a > x > b, we can simplify further:

area = (a × x) / 2 - b^2 / 2

Now, we can see that the answer is:

The answer is A) (ay - by) / 2.

C) 120 kmph
D) 70 kmph
E) 80 kmph
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the distance the car travels is x kilometers.

We know that the car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr, so the time it takes to cover the distance is:

time = distance / speed

time = x / 60

We also know that the car travels the same distance in 10 hours, so we can set up an equation:

x / 60 = 10

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 600

So, the distance the car travels is 600 kilometers.

Now, we can find out the speed at which the car travels to cover the distance in 10 hours:

speed = distance / time

speed = 600 / 10

speed = 60 km/hr

Therefore, the answer is:

E) 13 / 45
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

Let's say the question is answered correctly. We know that Alan has a 1/5 probability of guessing correctly, so the probability that Alan guesses correctly is 1/5.

Now, let's consider Roger's probability of answering correctly. Since he cheats by looking at the paper of the student in front of him, his probability of answering correctly is 2/3.

Finally, let's consider Peter's probability of answering correctly. Since he dutifully performs the calculations and marks the answer, his probability of answering correctly is 5/6.

Now, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to find the probability that none of the three friends cheated.

We can use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to find this probability. The probability that none of the friends cheated is equal to the probability that Alan did not guess correctly, plus the probability that Roger did not cheat, plus the probability that Peter did not cheat, minus the probability that all three friends cheated.

Using the given probabilities, we can calculate as follows:

The probability that Alan did not guess correctly is 4/5.
The probability that Roger did not cheat is 1/3.
The probability that Peter did not cheat is 5/6.
The probability that all three friends cheated is (2/3) x (1/3) x (1/6) = 1/18.

Now, let's calculate the required probability:

The answer is:

C) 23/90.

The probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating, is 23/90, or approximately 0.26.",A

B) 12 %
C) 6 %
D) 8 %
E) 4 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The problem states that the difference between simple interest and compound interest at the same rate for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72.

Simple interest is calculated as:

Simple interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is Rs. 5000, the time is 2 years, and the rate is x (we don't know the rate yet).

So, the simple interest is:

Simple interest = Rs. 5000 x x x 2 = Rs. 10,000

Now, let's find the compound interest. The formula for compound interest is:

Compound interest = Principal x (1 + Rate/n)^(n\*Time)

In this case, the principal is Rs. 5000, the time is 2 years, and the rate is x (we don't know the rate yet). The number of times the interest is compounded is n = 2 (since the interest is compounded annually).

So, the compound interest is:

Compound interest = Rs. 5000 x (1 + x/2)^(2\*2) = Rs. 5000 x (1 + x/2)^4 = Rs. 5000 x 2^4 = Rs. 16,000

Now, we can find the difference between the simple interest and the compound interest:

Difference = Compound interest - Simple interest
= Rs. 16,000 - Rs. 10,000
= Rs. 6,000

So, the answer is:

The answer is Rs. 6,000.

The rate of interest is x = 8% (since the difference between the simple and compound interest is Rs. 6,000, and the principal amount is Rs. 5000).",B

* 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.
* 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.
* The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.

Let's start by finding the number of files infected only by a virus:

* 50% of 250 is 125 (files not infected by a virus)
* Number of files infected only by a virus = 250 - 125 = 125

Now, let's find the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm:

* Number of files infected by both a virus and a worm = 125 (files infected only by a virus) x 2.5 = 312

Now, we can find the number of files not infected by a worm:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say Mohan's share is x. So, Sohan's share is 5100 - x.

We know that if they invest their shares at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they will receive equal amounts when they turn 26.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + (5100 - x) = 5100 x 1.04^26

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 5100 = 5100 x 1.04^26

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

The answer is C) 2600.

B) 20 xy / w
C) 5 xy / ( 12 w)
D) w / ( 3 xy)
E) 3 y / ( wx)
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem:

* The liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds.
* We want to find out how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain.

Now, let's think about how we can use the information given to solve the problem. We know that the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is w/25 gallons per x seconds, and we want to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain.

To do this, we can start by converting the rate from gallons per seconds to gallons per minute. There are 60 seconds in 1 minute, so:

w/25 gallons/second = (w/25) x 60/1 = 24w/250

Now, we can use this rate to find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain. We know that y gallons is a certain amount of liquid that we want to pass through the drain, so we can set up the equation:

24w/250 = y/x

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 24w/250:

x = 24w/250 x 250/24 = 25w

Now, we can find out how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through the drain by multiplying the number of gallons by the number of minutes per gallon:

y/w = 25w x 60/1 = 1500

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is A) y/(1200xy)

Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The coin made of alloy is 2 mm thick and has a diameter of 15 mm, so its volume is:

Volume = π x (15 mm)² x (2 mm) = 3.33 cubic centimeters (cm³)

2. The weight of the coin is 30 grams, so the weight of the alloy is:

Weight = 30 grams x (1/3) = 10 grams (since the volume of the alloy is 3.33 cm³)

3. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals the volume of silver, we can assume that the weight of the aluminum is 10 grams as well.

Now, let's consider the coin made of pure aluminum:

1. The diameter of the coin is 1 x 30 mm = 30 mm
2. The thickness of the coin is not given, so we'll assume it's the same as the alloy coin, i.e., 2 mm
3. The volume of the coin is:

Volume = π x (30 mm)² x (2 mm) = 12.97 cubic centimeters (cm³)

4. Since the weight of the aluminum in the alloy is 10 grams, the weight of the pure aluminum coin would be:

Weight = 12.97 cm³ x (1/3) = 4.32 grams

C) 150
D) 210
E) 220
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* 2/3 of a number is equal to 40
* Subtracting 10 from 2/3 of a number gives us the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number

Let's start by finding 2/3 of a number. We can do this by dividing the number by 3:

2/3 = (number) / 3

Now, we know that 2/3 of the number is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation:

(number) / 3 = 40

To solve for the number, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:

(number) = 3 x 40

(number) = 120

Now, we know that the number is 120.

Next, we need to find the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number. To do this, we can multiply 40 by 3 and add the result to the number:

40 x 3 = 120 + 120

40 x 3 = 360

So, the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number is 360.

Answer Choices:
A) 9

D) 8
E) 12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: The quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 can be factored as (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0. Therefore, we need to find the largest integer value of k for which both (x - 3) and (x - 2) are simultaneously zero.

The roots of (x - 3) = 0 are x = 3 and x = -3.

The roots of (x - 2) = 0 are x = 2 and x = -2.

Since we need two distinct roots, we can only consider k values that make both (x - 3) and (x - 2) simultaneously zero.

For k = 3, (x - 3) = 0 has two distinct roots at x = 3 and x = -3, but (x - 2) = 0 has no real roots.

For k = 2, (x - 2) = 0 has two distinct roots at x = 2 and x = -2, but (x - 3) = 0 has no real roots.

Therefore, the largest integer value of k for which the quadratic equation has two real and distinct roots is k = 2.

C) 30 %
D) 35 %
E) 40 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, and each time the dog ate, it consumed exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl. This means that at each feeding session, the amount of dog food left in the bowl is reduced by 1/3.

We know that the dog ate exactly once an hour, starting at 8:00 am. So, the first feeding session was at 8:00 am, and the dog ate 1/3 of the dog food left in the bowl at that time.

Since the dog ate once an hour, the next feeding session was at 9:00 am, and the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining dog food again. This means that at 9:00 am, there was 1/3 of the dog food left in the bowl that the dog had not eaten yet.

We can continue this pattern to find out how much dog food was left in the bowl at each feeding session:

* At 8:00 am, there was 100% of the dog food left in the bowl (100/3 = 33.33% of the dog food was eaten at each feeding session)
* At 9:00 am, there was 66.67% of the dog food left in the bowl (66.67% of the dog food was eaten at each feeding session)
* At 10:00 am, there was 40% of the dog food left in the bowl (40% of the dog food was eaten at each feeding session)
* At 11:00 am, there was 20% of the dog food left in the bowl (20% of the dog food was eaten at each feeding session)

So, at noon (12:00 pm), there was 20% of the dog food left in the bowl.

D) 200
E) 80
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. 60% of the people who took the survey were women.
2. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.

We can start by finding out how many women took the survey. Since 60% of the survey takers were women, we can find the number of women by multiplying the total number of survey takers by the percentage of women:

Number of women = Total number of survey takers x 60%
= 100 x 60%
= 60

So, there were 60 women who took the survey.

Now, we can find out how many men took the survey by subtracting the number of women from the total number of survey takers:

Number of men = Total number of survey takers - Number of women
= 100 - 60
= 40

Since 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars, we can find out how many men preferred red cars by multiplying the number of men by the percentage:

Number of men who preferred red cars = Number of men x 75%
= 40 x 75%
= 30

Now, we can find out how many people took the survey by adding the number of women and the number of men who preferred red cars:

Total number of survey takers = Number of women + Number of men who preferred red cars
= 60 + 30
= 90

C) 1.25
D) 1.5
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break this down step by step.

1. We know that 40% of the soft drink is orange juice, so the amount of orange juice in one gallon is:

40% of 1 gallon = 0.4 x 1 gallon = 0.4 gallons

2. We also know that 60% of the soft drink is water, so the amount of water in one gallon is:

60% of 1 gallon = 0.6 x 1 gallon = 0.6 gallons

3. To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add an amount of orange juice such that:

0.6 gallons (water) + x gallons (orange juice) = 1 gallon (total)

where x is the amount of orange juice we need to add.

4. Solving for x, we get:

x = (1 gallon - 0.6 gallons) / 0.4 gallons

x = (1 - 0.6) / 0.4

x = 0.4 / 0.4

x = 1

So, the answer is:

The answer is 1 gallon.

Therefore, to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to mix in 1 gallon of orange juice.",A

C) 68 %
D) 72 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say there are x passing students and y failing students. We know that the total number of students is 100, so x + y = 100.

We know that the passing students have an average of 83, so the sum of their scores is 83x.

We also know that the failing students have an average of 55, so the sum of their scores is 55y.

The overall class average is 76, so we can set up the following equation:

83x + 55y = 76(100)

Now, we can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

83x + 55y = 8300 + 5500 = 13800

Now, we can see that the total number of students is 13800, so we can find the percentage of passing students by dividing the number of passing students by the total number of students:

(x/100) = (83x/13800) = 0.60

So, the answer is:

The answer is 60% of the class passed.

1. The average wage for the fortnight is $90 per day.
2. The average wage for the first 7 days was $87 per day.
3. The average wage for the last 7 days was $92 per day.

Now, let's calculate the total wage for the first 7 days:

7 days x $87 per day = $606

And the total wage for the last 7 days:

7 days x $92 per day = $654

Total wage for the fortnight = $606 + $654 = $1260

Now, we can calculate the wage for the 8th day:

Wage for the 8th day = Total wage for the fortnight / 15 days
= $1260 / 15 days
= $84 per day

D) 42
E) 58
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. We know that the two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, so we can write:

a = 3x and b = 5x

where x is a constant.

2. We are told that 9 is subtracted from each number, so we can write:

a - 9 = 3x - 9 and b - 9 = 5x - 9

3. We are also given that the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23, so we can write:

a - 9 = 12k and b - 9 = 23k

where k is a constant.

4. Now we can set up a system of linear equations using the information we have:

3x - 9 = 12k
5x - 9 = 23k

Solving this system of equations, we get:

3x = 12k + 9
5x = 23k + 9

Simplifying, we get:

3x = 22k
5x = 42k

Now we can substitute the value of x we found earlier:

3x = 22(3) = 66
5x = 42(3) = 126

So the smaller number is:

b = 5x = 126

The answer is:

B) 126",B

A) 40
B) 60
C) 70
D) 80
E) 90
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* Ajay's present age is x.
* If 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, the remainder is divided by 18, and the result is Rahul's present age.
* Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, whose age is 5 years.

We can start by subtracting 6 years from Ajay's present age:

x - 6 = ... (remainder)

Since the remainder is divided by 18, we can write:

(x - 6) / 18 = Rahul's present age

Now, we know that Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, so we can write:

Rahul's present age = Denis's present age - 2

Substituting the expression for Rahul's present age into the equation we derived earlier, we get:

(x - 6) / 18 = (Denis's present age - 2)

Now we can solve for x, Ajay's present age:

x - 6 = (Denis's present age - 2) x 18

Simplifying, we get:

x = 4(Denis's present age) - 12

Since Denis's present age is 5 years, we can substitute this value into the expression for x:

x = 4(5) - 12

x = 20 - 12

x = 8

So, Ajay's present age is 8 years.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start with the given information:

* The average weight of 10 oarsmen in a boat is 60 kg.
* One of the crew members, who weighs 53 kg, is replaced by a new man.

We want to find the weight of the new man.

First, let's calculate the old average weight:

10 x 60 = 600

Now, let's calculate the new average weight:

10 x x = 600 + 53 = 653

where x is the weight of the new man.

Now, we can set up a equation:

10 x = 653 - 53

10 x = 600

Now, we can solve for x:

10 x = 600

x = 60

So, the weight of the new man is 60 kg.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

There are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box without selecting the ball with number 3 marked on it.

To count the number of ways to select two balls, we can use the multiplication principle. The first ball can be selected in n ways (since there are n balls in total), and for each of those ways, there are n-1 ways to select the second ball (since we don't want to select the ball with number 3).

So, the total number of ways to select two balls is:

n x (n-1) = n^2 - 1

Since there are 45 different ways to select two balls, we can set up the equation:

n^2 - 1 = 45

Now, we can solve for n:

n = 11

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given options:

I. Q is the square of a prime number:

If Q is the square of a prime number, then it can be written as $Q = p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that $p^2$ must have at least 5 factors. However, the only prime number with 5 factors is 5, and $5^2 = 25$, which has more than 5 factors. Therefore, this option is not possible.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number:

If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, then it can be written as $Q = p^4$, where $p$ is a prime number. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that $p^4$ must have at least 5 factors. However, the only prime number with 5 factors is 5, and $5^4 = 625$, which has more than 5 factors. Therefore, this option is not possible.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers:

If Q is the product of two prime numbers, then it can be written as $Q = ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that both $a$ and $b$ must have at least 5 factors. However, there are no prime numbers with 5 factors, so this option is not possible.

E) 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

1. Without a membership, renting a DVD costs $4.00.
2. With a membership, renting a DVD costs $2.00.
3. The membership costs $7.00 per month.

To determine the minimum number of DVDs you would need to rent to make it worth it to purchase a membership, we need to calculate the total cost of renting those DVDs without a membership and compare it to the cost of the membership.

Without a membership:

1. DVD rental cost = $4.00 x number of DVDs rented

With a membership:

1. DVD rental cost = $2.00 x number of DVDs rented

Now, we need to find the minimum number of DVDs you would need to rent to make it worth it to purchase a membership. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Minimum number of DVDs = (Total cost of renting DVDs without a membership) / (DVD rental cost with a membership)

Substituting the values, we get:

Minimum number of DVDs = ($4.00 x number of DVDs rented) / ($2.00 x number of DVDs rented)

Simplifying, we get:

Minimum number of DVDs = $4.00 / $2.00

Minimum number of DVDs = 2

So, the answer is B) 2. The minimum number of DVDs you would need to rent to make it worth it to purchase a membership is 2 DVDs.</s>",D

E) 20
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 12 hours per yacht.
2. Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so he cleans two-thirds of the yacht in 12 hours.
3. Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, so Jill can clean 5% of the yacht in 12 hours.
4. To find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we need to find out how much of the yacht is left to be cleaned.
5. To do this, we subtract the amount that Jack cleaned (two-thirds of the yacht) from the total amount of work (the entire yacht):

Remaining work = Total work - Amount cleaned by Jack
= 100% - (2/3)
= 100% - 66.67%
= 33.33%

So, Jill has to clean 33.33% of the yacht.

Now, we can use the information that Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do to find out how long it takes Jill to finish the remaining work:

Time taken by Jill = (Amount of work) x (Rate of cleaning)
= (33.33%) x (5/100)
= 1.667 hours

So, the professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university got Rs. 300 on interest.

We know that the simple interest formula is:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is Rs. 5000, the time is 3 years, and we need to find the rate.

We can set up the equation:

Interest = 5000 x Rate x 3

We know that the interest is Rs. 300, so we can substitute that in:

300 = 5000 x Rate x 3

Now, we can solve for the rate:

Rate = 300 / (5000 x 3)

Rate = 300 / 15000

B) 27 / AB
C) AB / 270
D) 2700 / AB
E) 100 AB / 27
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

We know that 27 bottles of soda cost $A cents. To find out how much B bottles will cost, we can set up a proportion:

27 bottles x $A cents = B bottles x $?

We know that the cost per bottle is the same for both cases, so we can cross-multiply:

27 x $A = B x $?

Now we can simplify:

27 x $A = B x $A

Since $A is the cost per bottle, we can divide both sides by $A to get:

27 = B x $A / $A

Now we can simplify further:

27 = B x $A / $A

Simplifying, we get:

27 = B x 1 / $A

Now we can see that $A is the denominator of the fraction, so we can multiply both sides by $A to get:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can simplify:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can see that $A is the cost per bottle, so we can multiply both sides by $A to get:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can simplify:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can see that $A is the cost per bottle, so we can multiply both sides by $A to get:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can simplify:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can see that $A is the cost per bottle, so we can multiply both sides by $A to get:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can simplify:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can see that $A is the cost per bottle, so we can multiply both sides by $A to get:

27 x $A = B x $A x $A

Now we can simplify:",A

each . How many ways can 3 candy bars be selected from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $ 4 ?
Answer Choices:
A) 8
B) 28
C) 46
D) 66
E) 70
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We have 11 candy bars in total, and we want to select 3 of them.
2. We know that 3 candy bars cost $50 each, so the total cost of these 3 candy bars is $50 x 3 = $150.
3. We also know that 4 candy bars cost $1 each, so the total cost of these 4 candy bars is $1 x 4 = $4.
4. Therefore, the total cost of all 11 candy bars is $150 + $4 = $154.

Now, we need to find out how many ways we can select 3 candy bars from the 11 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4.

To do this, we can use the fact that the total cost of the 3 expensive candy bars is $150, and the total cost of the 4 cheap candy bars is $4. So, the total cost of any combination of candy bars will be either $150, $154, or $158 (since we can't select any of the expensive candy bars alone, as they cost $50 each).

Therefore, we can select 3 candy bars in the following ways:

* 3 expensive candy bars: $150
* 2 expensive candy bars and 1 cheap candy bar: $150 + $4 = $154
* 1 expensive candy bar and 2 cheap candy bars: $150 + $4 + $4 = $158

So, there are 3 possible combinations of candy bars that have a total cost more than $4:

* 3 expensive candy bars
* 2 expensive candy bars and 1 cheap candy bar
* 1 expensive candy bar and 2 cheap candy bars

We know that exactly 2/5 of the children in the class are girls, which means that 2/5 of 100 (the total number of children in the class) is the number of girls.

To find 2/5 of 100, we can multiply 100 by 2/5, which is the same as multiplying 100 by 0.4 (since 2/5 is the same as 0.4).

So, 2/5 of 100 is:

We know that Charles received $54,080 at the end of his one-year investment, including both interest and principal. We also know that the investment paid an annual interest rate of 8%, compounded semi-annually.

First, let's calculate the interest earned on the investment. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, we need to calculate the interest for each six-month period.

The interest for the first six months is:

8% of $50,000 (the principal) = $4,000

The interest for the second six months is:

8% of $54,080 (the new principal) = $4,326.40

Total interest earned = $4,000 + $4,326.40 = $8,326.40

Now, we can subtract the total interest earned from the total amount received to find the original principal:

$54,080 - $8,326.40 = $45,753.60

If five registered voters are chosen at random , what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election ?
Answer Choices:
A) 26.2 %
B) 32.8 %
C) 43.7 %
D) 59.0 %
E) 65.6 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

There is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election, so the probability of a voter not voting is 10%.

If we choose five registered voters at random, the probability that all five vote is (1 - 10%)^5 = 0.95^5 = 0.647.

The probability that exactly four of the five voters voted is therefore:

P(exactly four voted) = (5 - 1) x 0.95^4 x 0.1 = 4.85

So, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election is approximately 4.85 or 48.5%.

If the yard has an area of 240 square meters , how many meters of fencing does she need ?
Answer Choices:
A) 58
B) 62
C) 66
D) 70
E) 74
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by identifying the dimensions of the yard. Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, the yard must be a rectangle with three sides fenced. Let's call the length of the yard ""L"" and the width ""W"". Since the area of the yard is 240 square meters, we know that the area of the fenced sides must be 240 - 10 = 230 square meters.

Now, we can set up two equations:

1. The area of the fenced sides is 230 square meters:

L x W = 230

2. The length of the unfenced side is 10 meters:

L + W + 10 = ? (since we need to add the length of the unfenced side to the sum of the lengths of the fenced sides)

Now, we can solve the system of equations. We know that the sum of the lengths of the fenced sides must be equal to the length of the unfenced side:

L + W + 10 = L + W + 10

Simplifying, we get:

2L + 2W = 10

Now, we can solve for L and W:

L = 50
W = 30

So, the dimensions of the yard are 50 meters long and 30 meters wide.

The answer is:

C) 66 meters of fencing.

To find the number of meters of fencing needed, we need to add the lengths of the fenced sides:

50 + 30 + 10 = 60

Therefore, Alice needs 66 meters of fencing (60 meters for the fenced sides + 6 meters for the unfenced side).",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: To find the number of different codes that can be made, we need to first find the number of ways to choose the middle vowel, then the number of ways to choose the first and third consonants, and finally the number of ways to arrange the remaining letters.

1. Choose the middle vowel: There are 5 vowels to choose from, and we want to choose one of them to be the middle letter. So, the number of ways to choose the middle vowel is 5.
2. Choose the first and third consonants: We want to choose two consonants, one for the first position and one for the third position. Since we want the first letter and the third letter to be different, we need to choose two different consonants. There are 20 consonants in total, and we want to choose two of them. So, the number of ways to choose the first and third consonants is 20 x 20 = 400.
3. Arrange the remaining letters: Once we have chosen the middle vowel, the first and third consonants, we have 19 remaining letters to arrange. Since we want to make a 3-letter code, we can arrange these letters in 19 x 19 x 19 = 19000 ways.

So, the total number of different codes that can be made is 5 x 400 x 19000 = 98000.

E) 102 [/INST] A: We have a sequence of consecutive integers, starting from -50. Since the sum of the integers is 51, and the least integer is -50, we can infer that the sequence must contain both positive and negative integers to reach a positive sum of 51. Each positive integer added to the sequence increases the sum by 1, and each negative integer added decreases the sum by 1. Since the sum is 51 and we start from -50, the sequence must include at least 101 positive integers to reach a sum of 51.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say P eats at a rate of x candies per minute, and Q eats at a rate of y candies per minute. We know that:

1. P eating alone would take 10 minutes to finish the jar, so P's rate is 10/x candies per minute.
2. Q eating alone would take 5 minutes to finish half the jar, so Q's rate is 5/y candies per minute.

Now, we can set up a system of linear equations to represent the situation:

10/x + 5/y = ? (since both are eating simultaneously)

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by the least common multiple of 10 and 5, which is 20:

20/x + 20/y = 40

Now, we can solve for x and y:

x = 40/20 = 2
y = 40/20 = 2

So, both P and Q are eating at the same rate of 2 candies per minute. Therefore, it would take them both 2 minutes to empty the jar.

The answer is B) 5 minutes.",B

B) $ 51.00
C) $ 63.00
D) $ 70.00
E) $ 91.00 [/INST] A: The retailer sold the appliance for 40 percent above its cost, which means the selling price is 100% (the cost) + 40% (profit) = 140% of the cost. Given that the gross profit is $20, and it represents 40% of the cost, it means 40% of the cost is $20. So, if 40% of the cost is $20, then 100% (the cost) is rac{100}{40} 	imes 20 = $50. Therefore, the retailer sold the appliance for the cost plus the profit, which is $50 + $20 = $70. Hence, the answer is D) $70.00.</s><s>[INST] Q: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51 .

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The grocery sells a bag of ice for $1.25.
2. The grocery makes a 20% profit on each bag of ice.
3. The grocery sells 500 bags of ice.

So, to find the total profit, we need to multiply the number of bags sold (500) by the profit made on each bag ($1.25 x 20% = $0.25):

Total profit = 500 x $0.25 = $125

The answer is A) $125.",A
