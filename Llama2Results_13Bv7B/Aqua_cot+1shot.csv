Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Given:

* The car is driving in a straight line towards the base of a vertical tower.
* The top of the tower is observed from the car.
* It takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

We can start by finding the height of the tower. We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so we can use trigonometry to find the height of the tower.

Let's use the tangent ratio to find the height of the tower:

tan(60°) = h / distance

where h is the height of the tower and distance is the distance between the car and the tower.

We know that the distance is constant, so we can set up an equation:

tan(60°) = h / distance

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

h = distance x tan(60°)

We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so we can find the height of the tower:

h = distance x tan(60°) = distance x 1.5

Now, we need to find the distance between the car and the tower. We know that the car is driving in a straight line towards the base of the tower, so the distance is constant. Let's call the distance ""d"".

We can substitute the value of h into the equation:

d = h / tan(60°)

Now, we can substitute the value of h:

d = distance x tan(60°) = distance x 1.5

Now, we can solve for d:

d = distance x 1.5 = distance x tan(60°)

We know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, so we can find the distance:

d = distance x tan(60°) = distance x 1.5

Now, we can solve for distance:

distance = d / tan(60°) = 1.5 / tan(60°)

We know that tan(60°) = ",A

D) $ 70
E) $ 78.20
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item.
2. The discounted price of the item was 22% of the original price.
3. The customer used a $20 coupon, so the amount paid by the customer is the discounted price minus the coupon amount.

Now, let's calculate the original price of the item:

1.90 = (100% - 22%) x Original Price

Since the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, we know that the original price must be greater than or equal to $61 (half of $1.90).

1.90 = (100% - 22%) x $61

Solving for the original price, we get:

Original Price = $65

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

We know that the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74.

We want to find the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur. This means we need to find the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month.

To do this, we can use the following formula:

P(neither) = P(A does not increase) x P(B does not increase)

We know that the probability that Stock A does not increase in value during the next month is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and the probability that Stock B does not increase in value during the next month is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

So, the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value during the next month is:

P(neither) = 0.44 x 0.26 = 0.1124 (or 11.24%)

2. The second 20 marbles pulled out contained 1 black marble, so the bag now contains x - 20 + 1 = x - 19 white marbles.
3. Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can set up the following equation:

(1/20) \* (x - 19) = (1/20) \* (1) = 1/20

Solving for x, we get:

x = 200

So, the bag originally contained 200 white marbles.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's start by using the information that at least 45% of the students attended the prom night. This means that the number of students who attended the prom night is at least 45% of 200, which is:

45% of 200 = 0.45 x 200 = 90

So, there are at least 90 students who attended the prom night.

Now, let's use the information that at least 35% of the students took part in the debating session. This means that the number of students who took part in the debating session is at least 35% of 200, which is:

35% of 200 = 0.35 x 200 = 70

So, there are at least 70 students who took part in the debating session.

Now, let's find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. To do this, we need to subtract the number of students who attended the prom night from the total number of students, and then subtract the number of students who took part in the debating session from the remaining students.

Total number of students = 200

Students who attended the prom night = 90

Remaining students = 200 - 90 = 110

Students who took part in the debating session = 70

Remaining students after subtracting students who took part in the debating session = 110 - 70 = 40

Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 40.

Answer Choices:
A) 226
B) 230
C) 240
D) 260
E) 280
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we know that the company sells all 420 units of the computer component every month, so the total revenue from sales is:

420 units x selling price per unit = $420 x <selling price>

We also know that the production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost for the month is:

420 units x production cost per unit = $110 x 420 = $46,200

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to find the selling price that will generate at least this amount in revenue, while still covering the production costs.

Let's start by calculating the yearly profit:

Yearly profit = 12 x (revenue from sales - production costs)

Since the company sells all 420 units every month, the yearly revenue from sales is:

Yearly revenue = 12 x $420 x <selling price> = $13,040 x <selling price>

Now, we can calculate the yearly profit:

Yearly profit = $13,040 x <selling price> - $46,200

To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to find the selling price that will make the yearly profit at least this amount:

Yearly profit = $626,400

Now, we can solve for the selling price:

$13,040 x <selling price> - $46,200 = $626,400

Simplifying the equation:

<selling price> = $280

The answer is C) $280.

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $280.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the total number of staplers produced on Monday is x.

According to the problem, 10% of the staplers produced were defective, so the number of defective staplers is 10% of x, or 0.1x.

Also, 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of non-defective staplers rejected is 2% of (x - 0.1x), or 0.02(x - 0.1x).

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the equation:

0.02(x - 0.1x) = 72

Now, we can solve for x. First, we can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 100 to eliminate the fraction:

0.02x - 0.2x = 7200

Now, we can add 0.2x to both sides to eliminate the negative term:

0.02x = 7200 + 0.2x

Now, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 0.02:

x = 7200 + 0.2x / 0.02

x = 7200 + 3600

x = 10800

So, the answer is:

The number of staplers produced on Monday was 10800.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Machine A puts out a yo-yo every 6 minutes.
2. Machine B puts out a yo-yo every 9 minutes.
3. We want to find out how many minutes it will take for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos.

Now, let's use a common ratio to compare the two machines:

Machine A: 1 yo-yo / 6 minutes
Machine B: 1 yo-yo / 9 minutes

We can set up a proportion to represent the relationship between the two machines:

1 yo-yo / 6 minutes = 10 yo-yos / x minutes

where x is the number of minutes it takes for both machines to produce 10 yo-yos.

Now, we can solve for x by cross-multiplying and simplifying:

1 yo-yo / 6 minutes = 10 yo-yos / x minutes

6 minutes / 1 yo-yo = x minutes / 10 yo-yos

x = 6 \* 10 = 60 minutes

Therefore, it will take both machines 60 minutes to produce 10 yo-yos.

C) 0
D) 15
E) - 15
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through the problem step by step.

First, we know that the retailer sold the appliance for 40% above its cost, so we can set up the equation:

Selling price = Cost + (Cost x Profit percentage)

where Profit percentage = 40%

We also know that the gross profit is $20, and it represents 40% of the cost, so we can set up another equation:

Gross profit = Cost x Profit percentage

Gross profit = Cost x 40%

Now we can substitute the value of the gross profit into the first equation:

Selling price = Cost + (Cost x 40%)

Selling price = Cost + $20

We can solve for the cost by subtracting $20 from both sides of the equation:

Cost = Selling price - $20

Cost = $70 - $20

Cost = $50

So, the retailer sold the appliance for $50.

Now, if we add +45 to the cost, we get:

Selling price = Cost + 45

Selling price = $50 + 45

Selling price = $95

And if we subtract -30 from the selling price, we get:

Selling price - 30

Selling price = $95 - 30

Selling price = $65

So, the answer is:

D) 1.2
E) 1.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that A and B are independent events, which means that the probability of one event occurring does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.

First, we'll find the probability of event A occurring:

P(A) = 0.2

Now, we'll find the probability of event B occurring:

P(B) = 0.8

Now, we'll find the probability of event A given that event B has occurred (P(A|B)):

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

We can find P(A ∩ B) by multiplying the probabilities of each event occurring:

P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B)

= 0.2 × 0.8

= 0.16

Now, we can find P(A|B) by dividing P(A ∩ B) by P(B):

P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B)

= 0.16 / 0.8

= 0.2

Now, we can find P(A/B) by multiplying P(A|B) by P(B):

P(A/B) = P(A|B) × P(B)

= 0.2 × 0.8

= 0.16

E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Okay! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the distance between each step is 1 meter, and the elevator moves at a constant speed.

If you walk 20 steps and stop, it means you have traveled a distance of 20 meters. Since you reach the bottom in 10 minutes, the speed of the elevator is:

distance / time = speed

20 meters / 10 minutes = speed

speed = 2 meters/minute

Now, let's analyze the second part of the problem. If you walk 10 steps and stop, you have traveled a distance of 10 meters. Since you reach the bottom in 20 minutes, the speed of the elevator is:

10 meters / 20 minutes = speed

speed = 0.5 meters/minute

Since the speed cannot be negative, the answer is:

The answer is C) 3 step/minute.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The problem states that the average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. This means that the highest score is x + 1 and the lowest score is x - 1.

The average score for the entire class is y, so we can set up the equation:

y = (x + 1 + x - 1) / 2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y = 2x + 1

Now, we know that there are z students in the class, and z is greater than 5. So, we can set up the equation:

y = (2x + 1) / z

Now, we need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers. To do this, we can subtract the highest score and the lowest score from the total number of students:

z - 2

So, the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:

(2x + 1) / (z - 2)

Simplifying this equation, we get:

3. Now, we need to calculate the final concentration of tea that John drinks. To do this, we need to find the percentage of the original solution that is not milk. In other words, we need to find the percentage of the original solution that is tea.

Let X be the percentage of the original solution that is tea. Then, we can set up the following equation:

X + 0.15 + 0.10 = 100

where X is the percentage of the original solution that is tea, and 0.15 and 0.10 are the percentages of milk that John adds.

Solving for X, we get:

X = 100 - 0.15 - 0.10 = 85%

So, the final concentration of tea that John drinks is 85%.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1/16 of the students study math, so there are 16 students studying math.
1/10 of the students study bio, so there are 10 students studying bio.
1/8 of the students study english, so there are 8 students studying english.

We know that the total number of students is a 4-digit number, so let's start by finding the maximum number of students.

Maximum number of students = 16 + 10 + 8 = 34

Now, let's find the minimum number of students. To do this, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16, 10, and 8.

LCM(16, 10, 8) = 240

Now, we can find the minimum number of students by multiplying the LCM by the number of subjects each student studies:

Minimum number of students = 240 x 3 = 720

So, the minimum number of students is 720.

The difference between the maximum and minimum number of students is:

Maximum - Minimum = 34 - 720 = -686

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

1. The principal amount borrowed is Rs. 500.
2. The interest rate is 6% per annum, which means the interest rate per year is 6/100 = 0.06.
3. To find the amount after 4 years, we need to calculate the interest for each year and add it to the principal amount.
4. The formula to calculate the interest is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
5. Since we are given that the interest rate is 6% per annum, we can calculate the interest for each year as follows:

Year 1: Interest = 500 x 0.06 = 30

Year 2: Interest = 500 x 0.06 = 30

Year 3: Interest = 500 x 0.06 = 30

Year 4: Interest = 500 x 0.06 = 30

6. Now, we add the interest for each year to the principal amount to find the total amount after 4 years:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The jeep travels a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey, so we can let the distance be x km.
2. In the return journey, the jeep increases its speed by 12 km/hr, so its new speed is x + 12 km/hr.
3. Since the jeep takes 4 hours to cover the same distance, we can set up the equation:

x + 12 km/hr x 4 hours = distance

4. Now, we can solve for x:

x + 12 km/hr x 4 hours = x + 48 km

5. Since the jeep travels for 4 hours at a speed of x + 12 km/hr, it covers a distance of:

x + 12 km/hr x 4 hours = x + 48 km

6. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the jeep is the distance it traveled in the forward journey plus the distance it traveled in the return journey:

Total distance = x + 48 km

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, the original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost, which means the retail price was:

Retail price = Wholesale cost x 1.6

Now, we know that the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, so the actual selling price was:

Selling price = Retail price x 0.8

We can now substitute the value of the retail price into the equation for the selling price:

Selling price = Wholesale cost x 1.6 x 0.8

Simplifying, we get:

Selling price = Wholesale cost x 1.28

Now, we want to find out what percent more than the wholesale cost the appliance was sold for. To do this, we can divide the selling price by the wholesale cost and multiply by 100:

Percent more than wholesale cost = (Selling price / Wholesale cost) x 100

Substituting the values we have found, we get:

Percent more than wholesale cost = (Wholesale cost x 1.28) x 100

1/4 inch (on the map) = 10 miles (actual distance)
20 inches (on the map) = x miles (actual distance)

where x is the actual distance from Town F to Town G.

Find the area of the sheet .
Answer Choices:
A) 1584
B) 1120
C) 792
D) 1320
E) 1200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the problem. We know that the rectangular sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set of sides, and a perimeter of 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides. This means that the length of the sheet is the same for both folds, so we can let the length be x cm.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. Since the sheet is folded along two sets of sides, we need to find the perimeter for each fold separately.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm, so we can set up the equation:

2(l + w) = 48

Simplifying, we get:

2l + 2w = 48

Now, when folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm, so we can set up another equation:

2(l + w) = 66

Simplifying, we get:

2l + 2w = 66

Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of l and w.

First, we can solve the second equation for w:

2w = 66 - 2l

Now, substitute this expression for w into the first equation:

2l + 2(66 - 2l) = 48

Simplifying, we get:

2l + 132 = 48

Subtracting 132 from both sides gives us:

2l = 36

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

l = 18

Now, we can find the width by substituting l into the equation for w:

w = 66 - 2l

Substituting l = 18 gives us:

w = 66 - 2(18) = 66 - 36 = 30

So, the dimensions of the sheet are length 18 cm and width 30 cm.

C) 18.3451
D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the problem.

The rectangular solid has a volume of 3 x 4 x 15 = 120 cubic units. Since all eight vertices are on the sphere, we know that the sphere must have a radius that is equal to half the length of one of the rectangular solid's edges.

The length of one edge of the rectangular solid is 3, so the radius of the sphere must be 3/2 = 1.5.

Now, we can use the formula for the volume of a sphere (V = (4/3)πr^3) to find the diameter of the sphere.

V = (4/3)πr^3

Substituting r = 1.5, we get:

V = (4/3)π(1.5)^3

Simplifying, we get:

V = (4/3)π(1.5)^3 = 18.3451

Therefore, the answer is C) 18.3451.

The marked price of the watch is :
Answer Choices:
A) Rs . 697.50
B) Rs . 712.50
C) Rs . 787.50
D) Rs . 750
E) Rs . 780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let the marked price of the watch be x.

The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5% on the marked price, so the selling price is:

x - (5% of x) = x - 0.05x = x - 0.05x

The shopkeeper earns a profit of Rs. 15 on the sale of the watch, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.05x = 15

Simplifying the equation:

0.95x = 15

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 / 0.95

x = 16

So, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 16.

If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7% instead, the selling price would be:

x - (7% of x) = x - 0.07x = x - 0.07x

The shopkeeper earns a profit of Rs. 15 on the sale of the watch, so we can set up the equation:

x - 0.07x = 15

Simplifying the equation:

0.93x = 15

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 15 / 0.93

x = 16.25

So, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 16.25.

E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given that the student found the value of 7/18 of the number instead of 7/8, we know that the student made a mistake in their calculation. Specifically, they overestimated the value of the fraction.

Let's call the actual number x. Then, we know that the student's answer was x + 7/18.

The difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is given as 770. So, we can set up the equation:

x + 7/18 - x = 770

Simplifying this equation, we get:

7/18 - x = 770

Now, we can see that the left-hand side is a constant value, while the right-hand side is a variable. So, we can equate the two sides:

7/18 - x = 770

Now, we can solve for x by adding 7/18 to both sides:

x = 770 + 7/18

Simplifying, we get:

x = 1728

D) $ 20000
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The fixed salary of the shop assistant is $500.
2. The sales commission is 5% of all monthly sales.
3. The monthly salary of the shop assistant is the sum of the fixed salary and the sales commission.

We know that the monthly salary of the shop assistant is $1500. So, we can set up the equation:

$500 + (5% of x) = $1500

Where x is the monthly sales.

Now, we can solve for x:

$500 + (5% of x) = $1500

$500 + 0.05x = $1500

0.05x = $1000

x = $1000 / 0.05

x = $20,000

So, the monthly sales of the shop assistant should be $20,000 for her monthly salary to reach $1500.

Find the average speed of the plane around the field ?
Answer Choices:
A) 384
B) 562
C) 458
D) 156
E) 452
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The plane flies along the four sides of a square, so it covers four sides of equal length.
2. The speeds of the plane are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr.
3. To find the average speed, we need to find the total distance covered by the plane and divide it by the time taken to cover that distance.

Now, let's calculate the total distance covered by the plane:

Side length of the square = distance covered by the plane

Since the plane flies along all four sides of the square, the total distance covered is:

Side length x 4 = distance covered

Now, we can substitute the speeds given in the problem:

Side length x 4 = distance covered

200 x 4 = distance covered

400 x 4 = distance covered

600 x 4 = distance covered

800 x 4 = distance covered

Now, we can add up all the distances covered:

distance covered = 200 x 4 + 400 x 4 + 600 x 4 + 800 x 4

distance covered = 800 + 1600 + 2400 + 3200

distance covered = 7200

Now, we can divide the total distance covered by the time taken to cover that distance:

Average speed = distance covered / time taken

Average speed = 7200 / time taken

Since the plane flies along all four sides of the square, the time taken is the same for all sides:

time taken = 1 hour

Average speed = 7200 / 1 hour

Average speed = 7200 km/hr

The answer is:

C) 7200 km/hr.",A

C) 7
8
D) 5
6
E) 11
12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total.
2. He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener.
3. So, the cost of each white sharpener is 1 rupee more than the cost of each brown sharpener.
4. Let's say the cost of one brown sharpener is x rupees. Then, the cost of one white sharpener is x + 1 rupees.
5. Since Jack buys 18 sharpeners in total, the total cost of all brown sharpeners is 18x rupees.
6. The total cost of all white sharpeners is 18(x + 1) rupees.
7. Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener, the difference in the total cost of all white and brown sharpeners is:

18(x + 1) - 18x = 18x + 18 - 18x = 18

So, the difference in the total cost of all white and brown sharpeners is 18 rupees.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

18x + 18 - 18x = 18

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 18 = 18

Solving for x:

2x = 18 - 18

2x = 0

x = 0

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 7 brown sharpeners and 11 white sharpeners.

Since Jack pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpener than for each brown sharpener, the cost of 11 white sharpeners is 11(x + 1) = 11(0 + 1) = 11 rupees more than the cost of 7 brown sharpeners, which is 7x = 7(0) = 0 rupees. Therefore, the total cost of all sharpeners is 7x + 11",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start with the information that 24% of all students at Daifu University are members of both the chess club and the swim team. This means that the number of students who are members of both clubs is:

24% of all students = 24/100 = 0.24 x 100 = 24

Now, we know that 20% of the members of the swim team are not members of the chess club. This means that the number of members of the swim team who are not members of the chess club is:

20% of the members of the swim team = 20/100 x 24 = 4.8

So, the total number of members of the swim team is:

Total number of members of the swim team = 24 - 4.8 = 20.2

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The population of the city increases by 5% annually, which means the population growth rate is 5%.

To find the population in 2 years, we need to calculate the population growth for each year separately:

Year 1:
Current population = 78000
Population growth rate = 5%
New population = 78000 x 1.05 = 82600

Year 2:
New population = 82600 x 1.05 = 87390

So, the population of the city in 2 years will be:

One car is riding at 12 mph and the second car is riding at 13 mph . How long after they begin will they meet ?
Answer Choices:
A) 1
B) 1.25
C) 1.50
D) 1.75
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's say the car traveling at 12 mph is the first car, and it starts at point A. The second car, traveling at 13 mph, starts at point B, which is opposite to point A.

We know that the distance between point A and point B is 50 miles. Since both cars are traveling at different speeds, we need to find out how long it will take for them to meet.

We can use the formula d = rt, where d is the distance, r is the rate (speed), and t is the time.

For the first car (traveling at 12 mph), the distance it covers in one hour is:

d = rt = 12t

Since it travels for 1 hour, we can set up the equation:

12t = 50

Solving for t, we get:

t = 50 / 12

t = 4

So, the first car will travel for 4 hours to cover a distance of 50 miles.

Now, we can find out how long it will take for the second car (traveling at 13 mph) to catch up to the first car. We can use the same formula:

d = rt

For the second car, the distance it covers in one hour is:

d = rt = 13t

Since it starts at the same point as the first car (point A), it will catch up to the first car after traveling for the same amount of time. So, we can set up the equation:

13t = 50

Solving for t, we get:

t = 50 / 13

t = 3.85

So, it will take the second car approximately 3.85 hours to catch up to the first car.

The answer is:

C) 1.50

Since the second car will catch up to the first car after 3.85 hours, and the first car will travel for 4 hours to cover a distance of 50 miles, the two cars will meet after 3.85 + 4 = ",E

2. The servant is also entitled to a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.
3. The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000.

Now, let's calculate the servant's monthly sale:

Monthly sale = Monthly salary + Commission
= 1500 + (15% of 1500)
= 1500 + 1500 x 15%
= 1500 + 1500 x 1.5

C) 10 %
D) 5 %
E) 12 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The man borrows Rs. 360, and he pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. To find the interest rate, we need to find the total amount of interest paid over the 12 months.

The total amount of interest paid can be calculated as follows:

Total interest = (Principal x Interest rate x Number of periods) / 100

where Principal is the amount borrowed (Rs. 360), Interest rate is the rate at which the interest is charged, and Number of periods is the number of months (12).

So, we can plug in the values:

Total interest = (360 x Interest rate x 12) / 100

Now, we can solve for Interest rate.

Interest rate = (Total interest / Principal x 100) / Number of periods

Interest rate = ( (360 x 12) / 100 ) / 12

Interest rate = (432 / 12) / 12

Interest rate = 432 / 12

Interest rate = 36

So, the interest rate is 36%.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Let's start by using the fact that the total amount of money in the pouch is Rs. 700.

We know that the 25 paise coin has a value of 25 paise, the 50 paise coin has a value of 50 paise, and the one rupee coin has a value of Rs. 1.

So, if we want to find out how many of each coin there are, we can set up the following equation:

25 paise coins:

700 / 25 paise = 28 coins (since 28 x 25 paise = 700)

50 paise coins:

700 / 50 paise = 14 coins (since 14 x 50 paise = 700)

One rupee coins:

700 / Rs. 1 = 700 / 100 = 7 coins (since 7 x Rs. 1 = 700)

So, the answer is:

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

We know that the man spends Rs. 3500 per month, and he saves 12 1/2% of his income. To find his monthly income, we can use the following formula:

Monthly income = Spending + Savings

We know that the spending is Rs. 3500, so we can set up the equation as follows:

Monthly income = Rs. 3500 + Savings

We also know that the savings is 12 1/2% of the monthly income, so we can calculate the savings as follows:

Savings = Monthly income x 12 1/2%

Now we can substitute the values we know into the equation:

Monthly income = Rs. 3500 + (Monthly income x 12 1/2%)

Simplifying and solving for the monthly income, we get:

Monthly income = Rs. 3500 + (Rs. 3500 x 12 1/2%)
= Rs. 3500 + (Rs. 3500 x 1.25)
= Rs. 3500 + Rs. 4400

C) 190 minutes
D) 70 minutes
E) 35 minutes
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

We know that Train A leaves the station every 16 minutes, so the first train leaves at 0 minutes, the second train leaves at 16 minutes, the third train leaves at 32 minutes, and so on.

We also know that Train B leaves the station every 17 minutes, so the first train leaves at 0 minutes, the second train leaves at 17 minutes, the third train leaves at 34 minutes, and so on.

Since both trains leave the station simultaneously, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 16 and 17. We can do this by listing the multiples of each number:

Multiples of 16: 16, 32, 48, 64, 80, ...
Multiples of 17: 17, 34, 51, 68, 85, ...

The least common multiple of 16 and 17 is 80, so the next time both trains will leave the station simultaneously is when the minute hand is at 80.

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 190 minutes.

Note that we can also find the answer by simply adding the two intervals: 16 + 17 = 33, so the next time both trains will leave the station simultaneously is in 33 minutes. However, this method is less efficient than finding the LCM.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The given hollow cube has a size of 5 cm and a thickness of 1 cm, so the volume of the cube is 5 cm x 5 cm x 1 cm = 25 cubic centimeters.
2. The cube is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm, so there are 25 smaller cubes in the hollow cube.
3. If the outer surface of the cube is painted, then the faces of the smaller cubes that are touching the outer surface will be painted.
4. Since the smaller cubes are touching each other along their edges, each face of a smaller cube is shared by two smaller cubes.
5. Therefore, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is equal to the number of faces of the hollow cube minus the number of faces of the smaller cubes that are touching the outer surface.
6. The number of faces of the hollow cube is 6 (front, back, left, right, top, and bottom).
7. The number of faces of the smaller cubes that are touching the outer surface is 25 (since each face of a smaller cube is shared by two smaller cubes).

Answer Choices:
A) 1 %
B) 2 %
C) 5 %
D) 9 %
E) 10 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. First, we know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so the number of cocoa flavored chocolates is 10% of the total number of chocolates, which is:

10% of 100 = 10

So, there are 10 cocoa flavored chocolates.

2. Next, we know that 90% of the remaining chocolates are squashed, so the number of non-cocoa flavored, non-squashed chocolates is:

90% of 90% of 100 = 90 x 9 = 81

So, there are 81 non-cocoa flavored, non-squashed chocolates.

3. Now, we want to find the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed. To do this, we need to find the intersection of the sets of chocolates that are vanilla flavored and not squashed:

vanilla flavored and not squashed = (vanilla flavored) ∩ (not squashed)

We know that all vanilla flavored chocolates are not squashed, so the intersection is:

(vanilla flavored) ∩ (not squashed) = vanilla flavored

Therefore, the number of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed is:

vanilla flavored = 100 - 10 - 81 = 19

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 5%.

There are 19 chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed, which is 5% of the total number of chocolates.",D

How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well ?
Answer Choices:
A) 25 days
B) 26 days
C) 27 days
D) 28 days
E) 29 days
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The frog is at the bottom of the well, so the frog's initial position is 30 m below the surface.
2. When the frog jumps up, it moves 3 m upwards, so its new position is 30 - 3 = 27 m below the surface.
3. When the frog falls back down, it moves 2 m downwards, so its new position is 27 - 2 = 25 m below the surface.

Now, we need to find out how many days it will take for the frog to come out of the well. We know that the frog can jump up 3 m and fall back down 2 m each day, so it will take:

27 m / 3 m per day = 9 days to jump up to the surface
25 m / 2 m per day = 12 days to fall back down to the surface

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 27 days.

Note: We can also solve this problem using a system of linear equations. Let's say the frog jumps up x m and falls back down y m. Then, we can set up the following system of equations:

x + y = 30 (initial position)
x - y = 2 (jump up and fall back down)

Solving this system of equations, we get:

x = 27
y = 25

So, the frog will take 9 days to jump up to the surface and 12 days to fall back down to the surface, for a total of 27 days.",D

Answer Choices:
A) 47
B) 91
C) 41
D) 67
E) 44
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The problem states that the sum of five consecutive odd numbers is a perfect square. We know that the sum of two consecutive odd numbers is always even, so the first odd number must be 1.

Let's assume the five consecutive odd numbers are x, x+1, x+2, x+3, and x+4. We know that the sum of these numbers is a perfect square, so we can write:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + (x+3) + (x+4) = (x+1)^2

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

x + x + 2 + 3 + 4 = x^2 + 2x + 4

Simplifying, we get:

5x + 10 = x^2 + 2x + 4

Subtracting x from both sides gives us:

4x + 10 = x^2 + 2x

Subtracting 2x from both sides gives us:

2x + 10 = x^2

Now we can see that x^2 is a perfect square, so x must be a perfect square. The only perfect square that is less than or equal to 10 is 4, so x must be 4.

Therefore, the five consecutive odd numbers are 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The sum of these numbers is:

4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 35

Which is not a perfect square.

How many students are there in the class ?
Answer Choices:
A) 850
B) 800
C) 900
D) 950
E) 1000
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by using the information that 8% of total students are interested in Football. This means that 8% of the total number of students are interested in Football, so we can set up the following equation:

8% of x = 8% of 100

where x is the total number of students.

We know that 4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, so we can set up the following equation:

4/5 of x = 4/5 of 100

We also know that 10% of total students are interested in Basketball, so we can set up the following equation:

10% of x = 10% of 100

Finally, we know that 20 students are not interested in any games, so we can set up the following equation:

20 - (8 + 4 + 10) = 20 - 28 = -8

Now we have four equations and four unknowns (x, 8%, 4/5, and 10%). Can you solve these equations to find the value of x?

The answer is:

The answer is C) 900.

To solve the equations, we can start by solving the first two equations for 8% and 4/5:

8% of x = 8% of 100 = 8 x 10 = 80

4/5 of x = 4/5 of 100 = 4 x 10 = 40

Now we can substitute these values into the third equation:

10% of x = 10% of (80 + 40) = 10 x 120 = 12

Finally, we can substitute this value into the fourth equation:

20 - (8 + 4 + 12) = 20 - 24 = -4

So, the total number of students in the class is 900.",E

E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

R is as much younger than Q as Q is older than T.

Let's assume R's age as R's age = x.

Then, Q's age would be x + 20 (since Q is 20 years older than T).

The sum of R and T's ages is given as:

x + T's age = 50

We know that Q's age is 20 years older than T's age, so:

Q's age = T's age + 20

Substituting the above equations, we get:

x + T's age + 20 = 50

Simplifying, we get:

2x + T's age = 50

Now, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age. We know that R is x years old, and Q is x + 20 years old.

So, the difference between their ages is:

Q's age - R's age = x + 20 - x

Simplifying, we get:

Q's age - R's age = 20

Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is 20 years.

The answer is:

We know that Sachin's current batting average is 51, and he scores 78 runs in the finals. To find out his new batting average, we need to divide his runs by the number of matches he played:

New Batting Average = (78 runs) / (number of matches)

We are given that Sachin's new batting average is 54, so we can set up the equation:

54 = (78 runs) / (number of matches)

Now, we can solve for the number of matches:

number of matches = (78 runs) / 54

D) 63 m
E) 64 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by given information:

A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1 m more than the 4 times the breadth.

Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular piece is x meters. Then, the length of the rectangular piece is 4x + 1 meters.

We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width. In this case, the width is x meters, and the length is 4x + 1 meters.

So, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is:

2(4x + 1 + x) = 2(5x + 1)

Simplifying, we get:

2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2

Now, we know that the area of the rectangular piece is 150 square meters, so we can set up the equation:

10x + 2 = 150

Solving for x, we get:

10x = 148

x = 148/10

x = 14.8

So, the breadth of the rectangular piece is 14.8 meters.

Now, we can find the length of the rectangular piece:

4x + 1 = 4(14.8) + 1

4x + 1 = 59.2 + 1

4x = 58.2

x = 58.2/4

x = 14.55

So, the length of the rectangular piece is approximately 14.55 meters.

C) 12.5
D) 14.5
E) 16.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

We know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to first find out how much of each vitamin is provided in 1 gram of the health food.

Let's start with vitamin E. We know that 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, so 1 gram provides 9% of the minimum daily requirement.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is x grams, so 1 gram of the health food provides 0.09x grams of vitamin E.

Now, let's find out how much of vitamin A is provided in 1 gram of the health food. We know that 1 gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, so 1 gram provides 8% of the minimum daily requirement.

The minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is y grams, so 1 gram of the health food provides 0.08y grams of vitamin A.

Now, we need to find out how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. We can do this by setting up two equations:

Equation 1:

0.09x + 0.08y = minimum daily requirement of vitamin E + minimum daily requirement of vitamin A

Equation 2:

x + y = daily amount of health food required

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y.

First, let's solve Equation 1 for x:

0.09x + 0.08y = minimum daily requirement of vitamin E + minimum daily requirement of vitamin A

0.09x = minimum daily requirement of vitamin E - 0.08y

Now, substitute the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and vitamin A into Equation 1:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour.
2. The kitchen is available for 3 hours.
3. 20 large cakes are needed, and each large cake takes 2 hours to make (2 large cakes per hour x 2 hours per large cake = 4 hours).
4. 700 small cakes are needed, and each small cake takes 0.5 hours to make (35 small cakes per hour x 0.5 hours per small cake = 17.5 hours).

Now, let's calculate the total number of cakes that can be made in 3 hours:

Large cakes: 20 x 2 = 40
Small cakes: 17.5 x 3 = 52.5

Total number of cakes: 40 + 52.5 = 92.5

Since 92.5 cakes are needed, and each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes per hour, we need to determine how many helpers are required to make 92.5 cakes.

Let's do this by converting the number of cakes to the number of hours each helper needs to work:

Large cakes: 92.5 / 2 = 46 hours
Small cakes: 92.5 / 0.5 = 187.5 hours

Now, we can see that we need a total of 46 + 187.5 = 233.5 hours of work to make all the cakes. Since each helper can work for 3 hours, we need:

233.5 hours / 3 hours per helper = 77.83 helpers

So, the answer is:

We know that the distance between R and S is 5, and the distance between R and T is 17. So, the distance between U and T is 17 + 5 = 22.

Now, we can use the fact that the distance between U and R is half the distance between U and T. This gives us:

distance between U and R = half of 22 = 11

Therefore, the length of line segment RU is 11.

C) 3
D) 2

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1. Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.

From the first statement, we know that two rolls have the same amount of falafel as six pita breads. So, the amount of falafel in one roll is equal to the amount of falafel in six pita breads.

From the second statement, we know that five baguettes have the same amount of falafel as three rolls. So, the amount of falafel in one baguette is equal to the amount of falafel in three rolls.

Now, let's compare the amount of falafel in one pita bread to the amount of falafel in one baguette:

One pita bread has the same amount of falafel as six pita breads, so the amount of falafel in one pita bread is 6 x 1 = 6 falafel.

One baguette has the same amount of falafel as five baguettes, so the amount of falafel in one baguette is 5 x 1 = 5 falafel.

Since one pita bread has 6 falafel, and one baguette has 5 falafel, we can see that one pita bread has more falafel than one baguette.

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) 21 %
B) 20 %
C) 25 %
D) 33 %
E) 18 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, the shopkeeper is selling items at a discount of 20% for one day, which means that if the original price of an item is x, then the sale price for that day is 0.8x (where 0.8 is the discount percentage).

On the other day, the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at the original price, so the sale price for that day will be x (the original price).

To find out by what percentage the shopkeeper must increase the price to original, we can calculate the difference between the sale price on the two days:

On discount day:
Sale price = 0.8x (original price)

On regular day:
Sale price = x (original price)

Now, we can calculate the percentage increase needed to reach the original price:

Percentage increase = (x - 0.8x) / 0.8x x 100%

Simplifying, we get:

Percentage increase = (x - 0.8x) / 0.8x x 100%
= (x - 0.8x) x 100% / 0.8x
= x x 100% - 80%
= 120% - 80%
= 40%

Therefore, the shopkeeper must increase the price by 40% to reach the original price.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given:

1. The bus fare for two persons for traveling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare for one person.
2. The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train between the two places is Rs. 1512.

Now, let's use this information to find the train fare for one person. We know that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so we can set up the following equation:

Bus fare for 2 persons = 4/3 x Train fare for 1 person

We also know that the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is Rs. 1512, so we can set up another equation:

Bus fare for 6 persons + Train fare for 8 persons = 1512

Now, we can substitute the equation for the bus fare into the equation for the total fare:

4/3 x Train fare for 1 person + Train fare for 8 persons = 1512

Simplifying and solving for the train fare, we get:

Train fare for 1 person = 1512 / (4/3) = 1512 / 3 = 504

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we have a straight picket fence composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets.

We can start by finding the total width of the fence, which is the sum of the width of each picket:

Total width = x x 1/2 = x/2

Now, we know that there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, so we can subtract the space between each pair of pickets from the total width:

x/2 - 6

Now, we can simplify the expression by dividing both sides by 2:

x/4 - 6/2

x/4 - 3

Now, we can simplify further by subtracting 3 from both sides:

x/4 - 3

x/4 - 3 = x/4 - 3/4

x/4 - 3/4 = x/4 - 1/4

x/4 - 1/4 = x/4 - 1/4

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem:

1. The ship traveled 180 miles.
2. The plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship.

We can start by finding the speed of the ship:

Speed of ship = 180 miles / time taken to travel 180 miles

Since we don't know the time taken, we can't find the speed of the ship directly. However, we can find the speed of the plane:

Speed of plane = 10 x Speed of ship

Speed of plane = 10 x (180 miles / time taken)

Now, we can substitute the value of the speed of the ship, which we just found:

Speed of plane = 10 x (180 miles / time taken)

Speed of plane = 10 x 180 / time taken

Now, we know that the plane and the ship meet after some time. So, we can set up an equation:

Distance traveled by plane = Distance traveled by ship + Time taken by plane

We can substitute the value of the distance traveled by the ship:

Distance traveled by plane = 180 + Time taken by plane

Now, we can substitute the value of the speed of the plane:

Distance traveled by plane = 10 x 180 / time taken + time taken by plane

Simplifying the equation:

Distance traveled by plane = 1800 + time taken by plane

Now, we can find the distance traveled by the plane:

Distance traveled by plane = 1800 + time taken by plane

We know that the plane traveled for 10 times the time taken by the ship:

Time taken by plane = 10 x time taken by ship

Substituting the value of the time taken by the ship:

Time taken by plane = 10 x 180 / 10 = 1800

Now, we can find the distance traveled by the plane:

Distance traveled by plane = 1800 + 1800 = 3600",C

C) 5000
D) 6000
E) 7500
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, in 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned, which means that 300 deer had tags in the forest that year.

In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and 20 of them had tags from the previous year. This means that 20/500, or 4% of the deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year.

If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, then we can assume that the same percentage of the total deer population in the forest had tags in both years.

So, if 4% of the deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year, then the percentage of the total deer population in the forest with tags in 2002 would be the same, or 4%.

Now, we need to find out what this percentage represents in terms of the total deer population in the forest. Let's use the information that 300 deer had tags in 2001 to help us.

If 4% of the deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year, and there were 300 deer with tags in 2001, then we can calculate the total deer population in the forest as follows:

Total deer population in 2001 = 300 (deer with tags) / 0.04 (percentage of deer with tags) = 7500 (deer population in 2001)

Since there was no change in population between 2001 and 2002, the total deer population in the forest in 2002 would be the same as in 2001, so:

Total deer population in 2002 = 7500 (deer population in 2001)

A) 0.9
B) 0.8
C) 0.6
D) 0.65
E) 1.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, so the first train on the main line starts at 5:00.
2. The harbor line starts at 5:02 AM, so the first train on the harbor line starts 2 minutes after the first train on the main line.
3. The frequency of both trains is 10 minutes, so the next train on the main line will start 10 minutes after the previous train, and the next train on the harbor line will start 10 minutes after the previous train.

Now, let's consider the probability of the man catching the first train:

The man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes. Since the first train on the main line starts at 5:00, the man can catch that train if it arrives on time. However, if the first train on the harbor line starts at 5:02 AM, the man will miss it if it arrives on time.

So, the probability of the man catching the first train is:

The answer is:

B) 0.8

Explanation:

The probability of the man catching the first train on the main line is 1/2 (since the train starts at 5:00 and the man arrives at 5:00), which is 0.5.

The probability of the man catching the first train on the harbor line is 1/2 (since the train starts at 5:02 AM and the man arrives at 5:00), which is 0.5.

Since the man can catch either the main line or the harbor line train, the total probability of the man catching the first train is the sum of the probabilities of catching the two trains:

0.5 + 0.5 = 1

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is 0.8 or 80%.",B

122 + 2.6 = 124.6 tons

Since the new heavy duty truck has a weight of x tons, we can set up the equation:

124.6 = 10 x + 2.6

Solving for x, we get:

10 x = 122

x = 122 / 10

x = 12.2

So, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 12.2 tons.

The answer is C) 12.2 tons.",A

Answer Choices:
A) 20 %
B) 40 %
C) 50 %
D) 65 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, if the population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years, and the population two years from now is expected to be exactly double the population of one year ago, we can set up the following equation:

Current population = Population one year ago x 2

We know that the population one year ago is the current population minus the population increase per year, so:

Current population - Population increase per year = Population one year ago

Now, we can substitute the expected population increase per year:

Current population - 10% of current population = Population one year ago

Simplifying and solving for the current population, we get:

Current population = Population one year ago x 2 + (10% of current population)

Current population = Population one year ago x 2 + (10% of Population one year ago x 2)

Current population = Population one year ago x 2 + 2 x 10% of Population one year ago

Current population = Population one year ago x 2 + 20% of Population one year ago

Now, we can see that the population one year ago is the population two years ago, so:

Current population = Population two years ago x 2 + 20% of Population two years ago

The answer is:

The answer is C) 50%.

The population of Boomtown has increased by 50% over the last year, since the population two years ago was doubled to become the current population.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's say Arjun has x dollars and Sajal has y dollars.

According to the problem, if Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, so we can set up the equation:

y = 2x

Now, if Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal, so we can set up the equation:

x + 10 = 3(y - 10)

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously.

From the first equation, we can solve for y:

y = 2x

y = 2(35)

y = 70

Now, from the second equation, we can solve for x:

x + 10 = 3(70 - 10)

x + 10 = 3(60)

x + 10 = 180

Now we can solve for x:

x = 180 - 10

x = 170

So, Arjun has $170 and Sajal has $70.

1. The greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11.
2. The least common multiple (LCM) of the two integers is 7700.
3. One of the integers is 350.

From the given information, we can start by finding the multiples of 350:

350, 700, 1050, 1400, 1750, ...

Since the LCM is 7700, we know that one of the integers must be a multiple of 7700. Let's check the multiples of 7700:

7700, 15400, 23100, 30800, 38500, ...

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
* The original piece of square cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece.

Let's start by finding the length of the rectangular piece of cloth. Since the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the length of the rectangular piece is equal to the original length of the square cloth minus 4 feet.

The area of the rectangular piece of cloth is equal to the area of the square cloth minus the area of the triangle that is cut out. Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, the area of the rectangular piece of cloth is:

Area of rectangular piece = Area of square cloth - Area of triangle
= (length x width) - (0.5 x base x height)
= (length x width) - (0.5 x 4 x 70)

Since the length of the rectangular piece of cloth is equal to the original length of the square cloth minus 4 feet, we can set up the equation:

(length x width) - (0.5 x 4 x 70) = 70

Now, we can solve for the length of the rectangular piece of cloth.

length x width - 0.5 x 4 x 70 = 70

Simplifying the equation:

2(length x width) - 350 = 70

Simplifying further:

2(length x width) = 350 + 70

2(length x width) = 420

Now, we can solve for the width of the rectangular piece of cloth.

width = 420 / length

Now, we can find the perimeter of the original square cloth.

Perimeter = 2(length + width)

Perimeter = 2(length + 420/length)

Perimeter = 2(length x 420/length)

Perimeter = 2 x 420

Perimeter = 840

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) 20
B) 30
C) 40
D) 200
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

M = abc (a three-digit number)
N = cba

M > N (M is greater than N)

M - N + 396c = 990

First, let's evaluate the expression M - N:

M - N = abc - cba
= a(b + c) - c(b + c)
= ab + ac - bc

Since M is greater than N, we know that ab + ac > bc. Therefore, we can write:

M - N = ab + ac - bc > 0

Now, let's add 396c to both sides of the equation:

M - N + 396c = ab + ac - bc + 396c
= ab + ac - bc + 396c

We know that M - N + 396c = 990, so we can set up the equation:

ab + ac - bc + 396c = 990

Now, let's simplify the equation:

ab + ac = 990 - bc + 396c

Since M is a three-digit number, we know that ab and ac are both positive integers. Therefore, we can write:

ab + ac = 990 - bc + 396c
= 990 - bc + 396c

Now, we can see that the equation is a true statement, since 990 - bc + 396c is a positive integer. Therefore, we can conclude that:

M - N + 396c = 990

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 400.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say Raj was x years old 5 years ago, so Raj's age 5 years ago was x - 5.

We know that Raj is currently 17 years old, so Raj's current age is 17.

We also know that Raj was one-third as old as Rahim 5 years ago, so we can set up the equation:

x - 5 = 1/3(Rahim's age 5 years ago)

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

x - 5 = 1/3(Rahim's age 5 years ago)

x - 5 = 1/3(Rahim's current age - 5)

x - 5 = 1/3(Rahim's current age) - 5

x - 5 = 1/3(Rahim's current age) - 5

Now, we can solve for Rahim's current age:

Rahim's current age = 3x + 5

Rahim's current age = 3(17) + 5

Rahim's current age = 3(17) + 5

Rahim's current age = 51 + 5

Answer Choices:
A) 51 days
B) 61 days
C) 71 days
D) 81 days
E) 91 days
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The field is circular, and the cow is tethered in the middle. So, the distance from the cow to the edge of the field is the same in all directions.

The area of the field is 10 sq ft per day, and the circumference of a circle is given by C = 2πr, where r is the radius of the circle.

Since the cow is tethered in the middle, the radius of the circle is half the length of the rope, which is 14 feet.

So, the circumference of the circle is C = 2π(14/2) = 2π(7) = 42π feet.

Now, we can set up a proportion to find out how long it will take the cow to graze the whole field:

42π feet / 10 sq ft per day = days

Simplifying, we get:

42π days / 10 = days

Now, we can simplify further:

42π days = 42 x π x days

Since π is approximately 3.14, we have:

42π days = 42 x 3.14 x days

Simplifying, we get:

42π days = 130.56 days

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 71 days.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. In the first month, the bill is Rs. 1800, and the number of calls consumed is 540.
2. In the second month, the bill is Rs. 2040, and the number of calls consumed is 620.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.
2. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.
3. The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.

Now, let's think about how many papers the hotel orders each day:

Sunday: Hotel orders 2x as many papers as it does the rest of the days, so it orders 2 x (1 x $4) = 2 x $4 = $8 worth of papers on Sunday.

Rest of the days (Monday to Friday): Hotel orders $1 worth of papers each day, so it orders 5 x $1 = $5 worth of papers per day.

Total number of papers ordered per week:

Sunday: $8
Rest of the days: $5 x 5 = $25
Total: $8 + $25 = $33

Now, we know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, so we can set up the equation:

$33 = $210 / (1 + 2)

Solving for x, we get:

$33 = $210 / 3

$33 = $70

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let x be the number of friends who attended the picnic.

We know that the total amount spent on eatables is Rs 96. So, the cost per person is Rs 96 / x.

We also know that four friends did not turn up, so the number of friends who did not turn up is 4.

The remaining friends had to contribute Rs 4 extra each, so the total amount contributed by the remaining friends is 4 x Rs 4 = Rs 16.

So, the total amount spent on the picnic is Rs 96 + Rs 16 = Rs 112.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

Rs 96 + Rs 16 = Rs 112

Simplifying the equation, we get:

x + 4 = 12

B) 11
C) 22
D) 25
E) 31
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the problem.

The wire in the shape of a rectangle has a length of 27 cm and a breadth of 17 cm. To form a square, we need to find a way to make the length and breadth of the rectangle equal.

Since the length of the rectangle is 27 cm, we can start by dividing it by 2 to find the half-length of the rectangle:

27 cm / 2 = 13.5 cm

Now, we can see that the breadth of the rectangle is 17 cm, so we can divide it by 2 to find the half-breadth of the rectangle:

17 cm / 2 = 8.5 cm

Now, we can see that the half-length of the rectangle is 13.5 cm, and the half-breadth is 8.5 cm. To form a square, we need to find a way to make these two values equal.

To do this, we can multiply the half-length by a factor that will make it equal to the half-breadth:

13.5 cm x 2 = 27 cm

Now, we can see that the length of each side of the square is 27 cm.

B) Rs 500
C) Rs 600
D) Rs 700
E) Rs 800
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let x be the amount each nephew receives. Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, each daughter will receive 4x.

The total amount the man has to distribute is Rs 8600.

The amount each son receives is five times as much as each nephew, so the amount each son receives is 5x.

We know that the sum of the amounts each son, daughter, and nephew receives is equal to the total amount the man has to distribute:

5x + 4x + x = 8600

Simplifying the equation:

9x + 4x = 8600

13x = 8600

x = 653

So each nephew receives Rs 653.

Since each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, each daughter receives:

A) 12 am on the next day
B) 5 am on the next day
C) 5 pm on the next day
D) 2 pm on the next day
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. We know that Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am and runs at a speed of 40 kmph, so it will cover the distance in:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = (Distance / 40)

Time = (Distance) / 40

Since we know that Train B leaves Mumbai Central at 2 pm and runs at a speed of 72 kmph, we can find the distance it covers in the same time period:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = (Distance / 72)

Time = (Distance) / 72

Now, we need to find the time at which the two trains meet. We know that Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am and Train B leaves at 2 pm, so the time difference between their departure times is:

Time difference = 2 pm - 11 am

Time difference = 1 pm

Now, we can use the times we found earlier to find the distance between the two trains when they meet:

Distance = (Time difference) x (Speed of Train A) + (Time difference) x (Speed of Train B)

Distance = (1 pm) x (40 kmph) + (1 pm) x (72 kmph)

Distance = 40 km + 72 km

Distance = 112 km

So, the two trains meet at a distance of 112 km from Mumbai Central.

The answer is C) 5 pm on the next day.

Note: The trains meet at 5 pm on the next day because the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is 112 km, and the speed of Train A is 40 kmph, so it will take 2.8 hours to cover the distance (112 km / 40 kmph = 2.8 hours). Train B, on the other hand, covers the same distance in 2 hours (112 km / 72 kmph = 2 hours). Therefore, the two trains meet at 5 pm, which is 2 hours after Train B leaves Mumbai",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

So, Mark tells John that if he gives him half of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that Mark's money is twice as much as John's, so John's money is half of Mark's.

If John has half of Mark's money, then John has half of Rs. 75, which is Rs. 37.5.

Now, John says that if Mark gives him one-third of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that one-third of Mark's money is Rs. 75.

So, one-third of Rs. 75 is Rs. 25.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
2. If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of water lilies will double from 1 to 2, from 2 to 4, from 4 to 8, and so on.
3. Since there are initially 64 water lilies on the lake, the number of water lilies after 2 days is 64 x 2 = 128.
4. The number of water lilies after 4 days is 128 x 2 = 256.
5. The number of water lilies after 6 days is 256 x 2 = 512.
6. Since it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, the number of water lilies after 60 days is 512 x 2 = 1024.

The answer is C) 53.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. 1 (initial number of water lilies) x 2 (doubling every 2 days) = 2
2. 2 x 2 = 4
3. 4 x 2 = 8
4. 8 x 2 = 16
5. 16 x 2 = 32
6. 32 x 2 = 64
7. 64 x 2 = 128
8. 128 x 2 = 256
9. 256 x 2 = 512
10. 512 x 2 = 1024

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 53 days.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. We know that ABCDE is a regular pentagon, so all the sides are equal. Let's call the side length ""s"".
2. Since F is at the center of the pentagon, all the lines passing through F are radii, and all the points on these lines are equidistant from F.
3. Now, we can draw a line from F to any point on the pentagon, and this line will divide the pentagon into two congruent triangles.
4. Since there are 5 points on the pentagon (A, B, C, D, and E), we can form 5-3 = 2 triangles by joining any two of these points with F.
5. Each triangle has two sides that pass through F, so we can draw a line from F to the midpoint of each of these sides.

C) 140 °
D) 160 °
E) 220 °
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by looking at the diagram:

In this diagram, we know that minor arc AC is 160°, and minor arc BD is 150°. We also know that B bisects minor arc AC, which means that BD is a straight line that passes through the midpoint of AC.

Now, let's look at the central angle that corresponds to the length of the arc AD:

AD is a central angle in the circle, and it corresponds to the length of the arc AD. Since BD is a straight line, we know that AD is a straight line that passes through the center of the circle.

Using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, we can set up the following equation:

AD + BD + AC = 180°

We know that AC is 160°, and BD is 150°, so we can substitute those values into the equation:

AD + 160° + 150° = 180°

Simplifying the equation, we get:

AD = 80°

Therefore, the measure of minor arc AD is 80°.

* 40% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.
* 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.

Now, let's find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:

* 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, so 75% of the remaining employees (i.e., 25% of the total) do not take a winter vacation.
* 40% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, so 40% of the remaining employees (i.e., 60% of the total) take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
* 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, so 20% of the remaining employees (i.e., 80% of the total) take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

where b1 and b2 are the lengths of the parallel sides (the widths at the top and bottom), and h is the height (the depth).

We know that the area of the cross-section is 640 square meters, so we can set up the equation:

640 = (10 + b2) \* h / 2

Now, we can substitute the given values:

640 = (10 + 6) \* h / 2

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan.
2. The fan rotates at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute.
3. We need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds.

Now, let's use the formula for the distance traveled by a point on a circular path:

distance = radius x number of revolutions x pi

In this case, the radius is half the distance from the center of the fan to the point on the edge of the blade, which is 10 centimeters. The number of revolutions is 300 revolutions per minute x 30 seconds = 9000 revolutions.

Now, we can plug in the values and solve for the distance traveled:

distance = (10 cm) x (9000) x pi

distance = 9000 x pi x 10

distance = 9000 x 3.14 x 10

distance = 27,720 cm

Therefore, the answer is:

D) 28 < x < 60
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have the equation:

x = (n^2 + 2√n(n+4) + 16)/(n+4√n+4)

First, let's simplify the expression:

x = (n^2 + 2n + 16)/(n+4)

Now, we can see that the numerator is a constant (16) and the denominator is a polynomial in n (n+4). So, we can factor out the common factor of 4 from the denominator:

x = (n^2 + 2n + 16)/4(n+4)

Now, we can see that the expression is in the form of a rational function, where the numerator is a polynomial and the denominator is a polynomial with a degree less than the numerator. So, we can use the rational function form of the equation:

x = (p(n))/q(n)

where p(n) is the numerator (n^2 + 2n + 16) and q(n) is the denominator (4(n+4)).

Now, we need to find the range of values of n for which the expression is valid. We can do this by looking at the factors of the denominator, q(n).

q(n) = 4(n+4) = 4(n) + 4

So, the factors of q(n) are 4 and (n+4). This means that the expression is valid for all values of n such that 4|n+4, or n+4 is divisible by 4.

Now, we can see that n+4 can take values between 4 and 72, inclusive. So, the range of values of n is:

n = 4, 5, 6, ..., 72

Now, we can substitute these values of n into the expression and see what values of x satisfy the equation.

For n = 4, we have:

x = (4^2 + 2(4) + 16)/(4(4+4)) = 20

So, x = 20 satisfies the equation for n",D

What then is the length of the space shuttle ?
Answer Choices:
A) 50 m
B) 75 m
C) 100 m
D) 125 m
E) 150 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Okay! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. We know that the space shuttle can travel 700 meters high in 40 seconds, so its vertical velocity is:

700 m / 40 s = 17.5 m/s

2. We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the space shuttle's horizontal velocity is:

5 s / 40 s = 0.125 m/s (since the horizontal velocity is 1/40th of the vertical velocity)

3. Now, we can use the formula for distance traveled to find the length of the space shuttle:

distance = velocity x time

In this case, the velocity is the horizontal velocity, so we can use that:

distance = 0.125 m/s x 5 s = 0.625 m

The answer is:

The answer is C) 100 m.

The space shuttle is 100 meters long, since it travels 0.625 meters horizontally in 5 seconds.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. A starts with Rs. 40,000.
2. B joins after 2 months with Rs. 60,000.
3. C joins after some more time with Rs. 120,000.
4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs. 375,000.
5. C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share.

Now, let's calculate the profit share of A and B:

Profit share of A = (40,000 x 2) = Rs. 80,000
Profit share of B = (60,000 x 10) = Rs. 600,000

Total profit = Rs. 375,000

Now, let's calculate the time period when C joined the business:

C's share = Rs. 150,000

We know that C joined after B, so we can calculate the time period when C joined by subtracting B's joining time from the total time period:

Time period when C joined = Total time period - B's joining time

E) 8.72
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The given paper is a square with one side of 20 cm. Two semi-circles are drawn on the opposite sides as diameters.

To find the area of the remaining paper, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the original square.

The area of each semi-circle is given by:

Area of semi-circle = (1/2)r^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle.

The radius of each semi-circle is half the length of the side of the square, which is 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm.

So, the area of each semi-circle is:

Area of semi-circle = (1/2)(10)^2 = 100 cm^2

Now, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the area of the original square:

Area of remaining paper = Area of square - (2 x Area of semi-circle)
= 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2 - (2 x 100 cm^2)
= 400 cm^2 - 200 cm^2
= 200 cm^2

The answer is:

D) 96 men
E) 97 men
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. We know that 1 man can complete the work in 6 days, so we can say that 1 day's work is 1/6 of the total work.
2. We want to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day, so we need to double the number of days that 1 man can complete the work in.
3. Therefore, we can say that 1 man can complete the work in 2 x 1/6 = 2/6 = 1/3 of the total work.
4. Since we want to find out how many men are required to complete the same work in 1/2 day, we can set up the following equation:

1/3 = (number of men) x (1/2 day)

5. Now we can solve for the number of men by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:

3 = (number of men) x (1/2)

6. Therefore, the number of men required to complete the same work in 1/2 day is:

3 = (number of men) x (1/2)

The answer is:

C) 95 men.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

1. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
2. He turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
3. He was still approaching B 3 hours before the end of his trip, and he was 70 miles away from B.

We know that the total distance traveled by Kevin is the distance from A to B plus the distance from B back to A. Since he traveled at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, the distance from A to B is:

distance from A to B = speed x time = 70 mph x 3 hours = 210 miles

Since he traveled at a constant speed of 90 mph from B back to A, the distance from B back to A is:

distance from B back to A = speed x time = 90 mph x 3 hours = 270 miles

Since Kevin was 70 miles away from B when he was still approaching B 3 hours before the end of his trip, the total distance traveled by Kevin is:

C) 21
D) 24
E) 25
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

If 30 is subtracted from a number, it is reduced to one-third of that number. So, if we start with a number x, then:

x - 30 = x/3

Now, we are asked to find 50% of the number x/3. To do this, we can multiply x/3 by 2/5:

(x/3) \* (2/5) = (x/3) \* 4/5

Since 4/5 is equal to 8/10, we can simplify this as:

(x/3) \* 4/5 = (x/3) \* 8/10

Now, we can simplify this as:

(x/3) \* 8/10 = x/3 \* 8/10

Since x/3 is the same as x/3, we can simplify this as:

x/3 \* 8/10 = x/3

Now, we can see that x/3 is equal to 8/10 of x, so:

x/3 = 8/10 x

Now, we can simplify this as:

x/3 = 8x/10

Now, we can simplify this as:

x/3 = 8x/10

Now, we can see that x/3 is equal to 8x/10, so:

x/3 = 8x/10

Now, we can simplify this as:

x = 8x/10

Now, we can simplify this as:

x = 8x

Now, we can see that x is equal to 8x, so:

x = 8x

Now, we can simplify this as:

x = 8x

Now, we can see that x is equal to 8x, so:

x = 8x

Now, we can simplify this as:

x = 8x

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, so we can write the number as:

a + b + c = 17

where a, b, and c are the digits of the number.

2. The sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so we can write:

a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109

3. Now, we are given that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order. So, we can write:

a + b + c - 495 = ?

4. To find the answer, we can substitute the values of a, b, and c into the equation:

a + b + c - 495 = 17 + 17 + 17 - 495

5. Simplifying the equation, we get:

a + b + c = 17 + 17 + 17 + 495

6. Now, we can see that the equation is a perfect square, and we can take the square root of both sides to get:

a + b + c = √(17 + 17 + 17 + 495)

7. Simplifying further, we get:

a + b + c = √(109 + 495)

8. Now, we can see that the equation is a perfect square, and we can take the square root of both sides to get:

a + b + c = √(504)

9. Simplifying further, we get:

a + b + c = 22

10. Finally, we can see that the answer is:

The answer is 223.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem:

* Alloy X is made of zinc and copper in the ratio 6:9.
* Alloy Y is made of zinc and copper in the ratio 7:11.
* 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are mixed to form alloy Z.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.

First, we can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y:

Alloy X: 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper
Alloy Y: 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper

Now, let's add the amounts of zinc and copper in alloy X and alloy Y to find the total amount of each in alloy Z:

Zinc: 6 (from alloy X) + 7 (from alloy Y) = 13
Copper: 9 (from alloy X) + 11 (from alloy Y) = 20

Now, we can find the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z by dividing the amount of zinc by the amount of copper:

So, Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to the bribery pool, and Smolapon contributes $4,000. That means their total contribution is $16,000 + $4,000 = $20,000.

The problem states that their total allows them to influence 30 senators. This means that each senator costs $20,000 / 30 = $666.67.

Since Hoopsmot contributed $16,000, he can influence 16,000 / $666.67 = 23.75 senators.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

1. The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000.
2. The sum of the numbers is 1000.

Let's start by solving for one of the numbers. We can do this by using the fact that the difference between the squares of two numbers is equal to the product of their differences:

(x^2 - y^2) = (x - y)(x + y)

Since we know the difference between the squares is 256000, we can set up the equation:

(x^2 - y^2) = 256000

Now, we can simplify this equation by factoring the left-hand side:

(x - y)(x + y) = 256000

We know that the sum of the numbers is 1000, so we can set up the equation:

x + y = 1000

Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for one of the unknowns by substituting the equation for x + y into the equation for (x - y)(x + y):

(x - y)(x + y) = 256000

Substituting x + y = 1000, we get:

(x - y) = 256000 / 1000

Simplifying, we get:

x - y = 256

Now we can solve for x:

x = y + 256

Substituting y = 1000 - x, we get:

x = 1000 - x + 256

Simplifying, we get:

x = 628

So, the answer is B) 628.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The coin diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.
2. She got a total of $3.40 after one dive.
3. Since the total amount is made up of copper and brass coins, we can write an equation to represent the situation:

Copper coins + Brass coins = $3.40

4. We know that the coin diver got 20 cents for each copper coin, so the number of copper coins can be found by dividing the total amount by the amount received for each copper coin:

Copper coins = $3.40 / 0.20 = 17

5. Since the coin diver got 25 cents for each brass coin, the number of brass coins can be found by subtracting the number of copper coins from the total amount:

Brass coins = $3.40 - 17 = 17

6. Since the number of brass coins is equal to the number of copper coins, the answer is:

The answer is C) 2.

Answer Choices:
A) 700 meters
B) 1000 meters
C) 700 kilometers
D) 555 meters
E) 600 meters
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Let's say the distance between A and B is x meters. Since Ram and Krishna are traveling at constant speeds, we can set up the equation:

Ram's distance traveled = Krishna's distance traveled + time taken by Ram to meet Krishna

Since Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds, we know that:

Ram's distance traveled = Krishna's distance traveled + 10 seconds

Now, we know that Krishna's distance traveled is 40 m/s x time = 40 x 10 = 400 meters

So, Ram's distance traveled = 400 + 10 = 410 meters

Therefore, the total distance between A and B is:

Total distance = Ram's distance traveled + Krishna's distance traveled
= 410 + 400
= 810 meters

The answer is:

B) 1000 meters.

Note that we have assumed that the speeds are constant, and the time taken by Ram to meet Krishna is 10 seconds. If these assumptions are not true, then the solution may be different.",E

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the distance between the cars at the starting point is 0 miles.

The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, so it covers:

55 mph x 15 miles = 825 miles in 1 hour

Therefore, the time it takes for the first car to cover 15 miles is:

825 miles / 55 mph = 15 hours

The second car travels at a steady rate of 52 mph, so it covers:

52 mph x 15 miles = 780 miles in 1 hour

Therefore, the time it takes for the second car to cover 15 miles is:

780 miles / 52 mph = 15 hours

Since both cars start at the same time and travel at constant speeds, they will be 15 miles apart after the same amount of time. Therefore, the answer is:

C) 8 : 2
D) 6 : π
E) 8 : 3
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's dive into this problem.

The volume of a cube is given by:

V = s^3

where s is the side length of the cube.

The volume of a sphere is given by:

V = (4/3)πr^3

where r is the radius of the sphere.

Since the sphere fits inside the cube, we know that the radius of the sphere is less than or equal to the side length of the cube. So, we can set up an inequality:

(4/3)πr^3 ≤ s^3

Now, we can simplify the inequality by multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

4πr^3 ≤ 3s^3

Next, we can simplify the inequality further by dividing both sides by 4π:

r^3 ≤ s^3 / 4π

Now, we can see that the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cube is:

r^3 / s^3 = (s^3 / 4π) / s^3 = 1 / 4π

So, the answer is:

The answer is A) 2 : π.

C) 55 %
D) 70 %
E) 58 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's calculate the percentage gain of the merchant:

1. First, we need to calculate the cost of 1 kg of oranges:

Cost per kg = Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5

2. Next, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from selling all 90 kg of oranges:

Total revenue = Rs. 7.50 per kg x 90 kg = Rs. 675

3. Now, we can calculate the profit (gross profit) earned by the merchant:

Profit = Total revenue - Cost
= Rs. 675 - Rs. 450
= Rs. 225

4. Finally, we can calculate the percentage gain by dividing the profit by the cost and multiplying by 100:

Percentage gain = (Profit / Cost) x 100

At what time do the 2 trains cross one another ?

A) 1 hr 23 min
B) 1 hr 15 min
C) 1 hr 8 min
D) 56 min
E) 55 min
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the situation:

Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, so the distance between City A and City B is 9 am - 5 am = 4 hours.

Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, so the distance between City B and City A is 10:30 am - 7 am = 3 hours and 30 minutes.

Since both trains are traveling in opposite directions, they will cross each other at some point. We can set up a system of equations to represent the situation:

Let x be the time at which Train M crosses Train N (in hours).

We know that Train M leaves City A at 5 am, so it has traveled for 4 hours before it crosses Train N. Therefore, we can set up the first equation:

x + 4 = 9 (since Train M reaches City B at 9 am)

We also know that Train N leaves City B at 7 am, so it has traveled for 3 hours and 30 minutes before it crosses Train M. Therefore, we can set up the second equation:

x + 3.5 = 10.30 (since Train N reaches City A at 10:30 am)

Now we can solve the system of equations. We can start by solving the first equation for x:

x + 4 = 9

x = 9 - 4

x = 5

Now we can substitute this value of x into the second equation:

x + 3.5 = 10.30

Answer Choices:
A) 1 minute
B) 2 minutes
C) 3 minutes
D) 4 minutes
E) 5 minutes
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say Janice bikes at a speed of 10 miles per hour, so she covers 1 mile in:

1 mile / 10 miles/hour = 0.1 hours

Therefore, Janice bikes for 0.1 hours to cover 1 mile.

Now, let's calculate how long it takes Jennie to bike 1 mile, who bikes at a speed of 20 miles per hour:

1 mile / 20 miles/hour = 0.05 hours

So, Jennie bikes for 0.05 hours to cover 1 mile.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for both Janice and Jennie to bike 1 mile collectively. We can do this by adding their biking times:

0.1 hours (Janice) + 0.05 hours (Jennie) = 0.15 hours

Therefore, it takes both Janice and Jennie collectively 0.15 hours (or 9 minutes) to bike 1 mile.

If the maximum mark M is converted into 800 marks , he would have secured 420 marks . What is the value of M ?
Answer Choices:
A) 278
B) 2890
C) 270
D) 2702
E) 960
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the original maximum mark was M.

We know that the candidate secured 504 marks, so we can set up the equation:

504 = M x (100/M)

where (100/M) is the percentage of the maximum mark that the candidate secured.

We also know that if the maximum mark was converted to 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks, so we can set up another equation:

420 = (M x 800)/M

Now we can solve for M by multiplying both equations by M:

504M = 504 x (100/M)M
420M = 420 x (800/M)M

Now we can simplify both equations by canceling out the M terms:

504M = 50400/M
420M = 33600/M

Now we can solve for M by dividing both equations by 504 and 420, respectively:

M = 50400/504 = 100
M = 33600/420 = 800

So the answer is:

B) 3.9 m
C) 4 m
D) 4.2 m
E) 4.4 m
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* The height of the room is 2.5 times its semi-perimeter
* The semi-perimeter is 2(50 + 50) = 2(100) = 200
* The area of the room is 15 sq m
* The width of the paper is 50 cm
* The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260

We can start by converting the height of the room from meters to centimeters:

2.5 x 100 cm = 250 cm

Now, we can calculate the area of the room in square centimeters:

15 sq m x (100 cm/1 sq m) = 1500 cm^2

Since the width of the paper is 50 cm, we can calculate the number of meters of paper needed to cover the walls:

1500 cm^2 / (50 cm/1 m) = 30 m

Now, we can calculate the cost of papering the walls:

30 m x Rs. 2/m = Rs. 60

Since the cost is Rs. 260, we can set up an equation:

60 = 260 - x

where x is the height of the room in meters.

Solving for x, we get:

x = 260 - 60

x = 200

So, the height of the room is 200 cm or 2 m.

The answer is:

C) 4 m

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The sum of k consecutive integers is given as:

1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = 51

We know that the least integer is -50, so we can start counting from there:

-50 + 1 + 2 + ... + k = 51

We can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

k + (1 + 2 + ... + k) = 51

k + k(k+1)/2 = 51

2k + k(k+1)/2 = 51

3k + (k+1)/2 = 51

Now, we can solve for k:

3k = 51 - (k+1)/2

3k = 51 - k - 1/2

3k = 51 - k/2

k = 152

D) - 16.2
E) Can not be determined
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0.

First, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation as:

x^2 + mx + 22 = (x + 12)(x + 2) = 0

Now, we can see that one of the roots is x = -12, so we can set that equal to one of the factors:

(x + 12) = 0

x + 12 = 0

x = -12

Now, we can substitute the value of x = -12 into one of the factors:

(x + 2) = 0

-12 + 2 = 0

2 = 0

This is a contradiction, so we can conclude that the other factor, (x + 12), must be equal to 0.

So, we can solve for m by substituting x = -12 into the equation:

m = -12 + 22

m = -10

1. The PM (Prime Minister) speaks first.
2. Then the MP (Member of Parliament) speaks.
3. After that, the MLA (Member of Legislative Assembly) speaks.

Since the PM speaks first, there are 10 possible speakers in total.

Now, we need to find out how many ways the meeting can be held, considering the protocol that the PM speaks before the MP and the MP speaks before the MLA.

Let's use a combinatorial argument:

There are 10 possible speakers in total, and the PM speaks first. So, the first speaker can be any of the 10 speakers.

Once the PM speaks, there are 9 possible speakers left, and the MP speaks next. So, the second speaker can be any of the 9 remaining speakers.

After the MP speaks, there are 8 possible speakers left, and the MLA speaks next. So, the third speaker can be any of the 8 remaining speakers.

D) $ 22.9
E) $ 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, we know that the original price of each article was $x, and Anna was able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after a 15% discount. So, we can set up the equation:

5(x - 15%) = 300

Now, we can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 5:

5x - 75 = 300

Next, we can add 75 to both sides to get:

5x = 375

Now, we can divide both sides by 5 to solve for x:

x = 75

So, the original price of each article was $75.

Now, we can find the new selling price of each article by subtracting the discount percentage from the original price:

New price = Original price - Discount percentage

New price = 75 - 15%

New price = 75 - 11.25

New price = 63.75

D) 40 / 7
E) 50 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the total weight of the mixture is 10 kg, and the weight of the sand is 30% of the total weight, so the weight of the sand is:

30% of 10 kg = 3 kg

Now, we want to replace the sand with pure sand, so we need to remove the sand from the mixture and add pure sand to make up the difference.

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove the same amount of sand as clay. Since the weight of the clay is 70% of the total weight, we can use the same percentage to determine the weight of clay to be removed:

70% of 10 kg = 7 kg

So, we need to remove 7 kg of clay and add the same amount of pure sand to the mixture.

Now, let's calculate the amount of pure sand we need to add:

7 kg - 3 kg = 4 kg

So, we need to add 4 kg of pure sand to the mixture.

C) 4 kg

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Allen starts from X and goes to Y, so he covers a distance of XY = 0 + 54 km = 54 km.
2. Bob starts from Y and goes towards X, so he covers a distance of YX = 0 + 78 km = 78 km.
3. When Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X, so he covers a distance of XY = 54 km.
4. When Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y, so he covers a distance of YX = 78 km.
5. The total distance covered by Allen is XY + XY = 2 \* 54 km = 108 km.

The distance between X and Y is the sum of the distances covered by both Allen and Bob. Since they meet for the second time, the distance between X and Y is the sum of their distances minus the distance between their starting points. In this case, the distance between X and Y is:

XY + YX = 54 km + 78 km = 132 km

Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, the correct answer is:

So, we know that the customer has two options:

Option 1: Buy new tires at a cost of $180 per tire.
Option 2: Repair the current tires at a cost of $40 per tire, which will make them last for one additional year.

We want to find out the average cost per year of the new tires compared to the cost of repairing the current tires.

First, let's calculate the cost per year for each option:

Option 1: $180 / 4 years = $45 per year
Option 2: $40 / 5 years = $8 per year

Now, we can calculate the percentage increase in cost per year for Option 1 compared to Option 2:

($45 - $8) / $8 = 500%

So, the average cost per year of the new tires is 500% greater than the cost of repairing the current tires.

How much interest had this bond accrued at maturity ?
Answer Choices:
A) $ 5102
B) $ 618
C) $ 216
D) $ 202
E) $ 200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The bond has a face value of $5,000, and it pays an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months.
2. Since the interest is compounded every six months, there are two interest periods per year.
3. The interest for each period is calculated as follows:

Interest = Face Value x Rate x Time

where Face Value is $5,000, Rate is 12%/2 = 6%, and Time is 6 months.

So, the interest for the first six months is:

Interest1 = $5,000 x 6% x 6/12 = $300

And the interest for the second six months is:

Interest2 = $5,000 x 6% x 6/12 = $300

Total interest accrued at maturity is:

Total Interest = Interest1 + Interest2 = $300 + $300 = $600

B) 25
C) 15
D) 20
E) 21
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say Sachin's age 10 years back was x. Then, Sachin's current age is x + 10.

We know that Sachin was twice as old as Ajay 10 years back, so Ajay's age 10 years back was half of Sachin's age, which is x/2.

Now, we know that Ajay's current age is x/2 + 10.

We are given that Sachin will be 40 years old in 10 years, so Sachin's future age will be:

x + 10 + 10 = 40

Simplifying, we get:

x + 20 = 40

Subtracting 20 from both sides gives us:

x = 20

So, Ajay's current age is:

x/2 + 10 = 20/2 + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20

B) 1700
C) 3440
D) Can not be determined
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The perimeter of a rectangular plot is given as 340 meters.

The question asks for the cost of gardening a 1-meter wide boundary around the plot.

So, we need to calculate the length of the boundary first.

The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is: P = 2(l + w)

where l is the length and w is the width.

Since the perimeter is given as 340 meters, we can set up the equation:

340 = 2(l + w)

Simplifying the equation:

340 = 2l + 2w

Now, we know that the width is 1 meter, so we can substitute that in:

340 = 2l + 2(1)

340 = 2l + 2

Solving for l:

2l + 2 = 340

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

2l = 338

Dividing both sides by 2:

l = 169

So, the length of the plot is 169 meters.

Now, we can calculate the cost of gardening the boundary:

The cost is given as $10 per square meter, so we need to multiply the length of the boundary by the cost per square meter:

Cost = 169 x $10

Cost = $1690

The answer is B) $1690.",C

Answer Choices:
A) 1.3
B) 1.5
C) 2.1
D) 2.5
E) 3.1
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

1. 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels.
2. The remaining revenue (100% - 34%) was from the sale of biographies.
3. The company's revenue from the sale of novels was approximately $x.

We can start by finding out the total revenue of Ace Book Company:

Total revenue = 34% of revenue (novels) + 100% of revenue (biographies)

Total revenue = $x + (100% - 34%) of revenue (biographies)

Total revenue = $x + 66% of revenue (biographies)

Now, we can set up a proportion to find the ratio of revenue from novels to biographies:

x + 66% of revenue (biographies) = Total revenue

x + 66%(biographies) = $x + 66%(revenue)

x + 66%(biographies) = $x + 66%(100% - 34%)

x + 66%(biographies) = $x + 66%(66%)

x + 66%(biographies) = $x + 43.2%

Now, we can simplify the proportion:

x + 43.2% = $x + 43.2%

2x + 43.2% = 2x + 43.2%

2x = 2x

x = x

So, the answer is:

The answer is A) 1.3

The revenue from novels is 34% of the total revenue, and the revenue from biographies is 66% of the total revenue. Therefore, the ratio of revenue from novels to biographies is 34% to 66%, or 1.3.",B

E) 55 seconds
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means it spends 3 seconds accelerating from its initial speed to its final speed while entering the tunnel.
2. The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, so we can calculate its speed as it enters the tunnel:

120 miles/hour x 1 mile/hour = 120,000 feet/hour

3. Since the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, we can calculate the distance it travels during that time:

120,000 feet/hour x 3 seconds = 360,000 feet

4. The tunnel is 1 mile long, so we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel:

360,000 feet / 5,280 feet per mile = 69.44 seconds

What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount ?
Answer Choices:
A) 247.67
B) 237.67
C) 227.67
D) 215.67
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The invoice for the motor boat is for $20,000 with terms of 4/30, n/100. This means that the merchant has 4 months to pay the invoice (4/30) and there is a 100% discount if the invoice is paid within the discount period (n/100).

To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to find the highest rate at which the merchant can borrow money and still be able to pay off the invoice within the discount period.

First, let's calculate the amount of interest that will be charged on the invoice if the merchant pays it within the discount period:

Interest = (20,000 x 4/100) x (1/12) = $500

Now, we need to find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money to pay off the invoice. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Simple Interest = (Principal x Rate x Time) / 100

In this case, the principal is $20,000, the time is 4 months (1/12 of a year), and we want to find the highest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money.

So, we can solve for the highest simple interest rate by setting up the equation:

20,000 x Rate x 1/12 = 500

Now, we can solve for the rate:

Rate = (500 x 12) / 20,000 = 247.67

Therefore, the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 247.67%.

C) 126
D) 252

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

There are ten lime soda bottles on the table, and we need to divide them among two groups of customers. We can start by selecting the first group of five customers.

There are ten bottles and five customers, so we can choose each bottle five times. This gives us:

10 x 5 = 50 ways to select the first group of five customers.

Now, we need to select the second group of five customers. Since we have already selected the first group, there are now only five bottles left. We can choose each of these five bottles four times (since we have already chosen one bottle for the first group), giving us:

5 x 4 = 20 ways to select the second group of five customers.

Now, we need to multiply the number of ways to select the first group by the number of ways to select the second group to get the total number of ways to divide the ten bottles among the two groups. This gives us:

50 x 20 = 1000 ways to divide the ten bottles among the two groups.

D) Rs . 8
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work through this problem step by step!

1. First, we know that the company produces 7200 pens and promises to deliver them to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. So, the total revenue from the sale of these pens is:

7200 pens x Rs. 10 each = Rs. 72,000

2. Next, we know that the company estimates an overall profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. This means that the total profit from the sale of the pens is:

72,000 x 25% = Rs. 18,000

3. Now, we also know that on average 10% of the produced pens are always defective and are rejected before packing. This means that the number of defective pens is:

7200 x 10% = 720 pens

4. Since these pens are rejected before packing, they do not contribute to the total revenue or profit. So, we need to subtract the cost of these defective pens from the total revenue and profit:

72,000 - 720 = Rs. 71,280 (total revenue)

72,000 - 720 = Rs. 17,680 (total profit)

5. Now, we can calculate the manufactured cost of each pen by dividing the total profit by the number of pens sold:

17,680 / 7200 = Rs. 5.6

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the two-digit number is xy, where x is the digit in the tens place and y is the digit in the ones place.

We know that the sum of the digits is x + y, and the number exceeds the sum of the digits by 18. So we can set up the equation:

x + y = ... (1)

We also know that the digit in the tens place is double the digit in the ones place, so we can write:

x = 2y (2)

Now we can substitute (2) into (1) to get:

2y + y = ... (3)

Combine like terms:

3y = ... (4)

Now we can solve for y:

y = ... (5)

Now we know y, so we can find x:

x = 2y (6)

Substitute (5) into (6) to get:

x = 2(3) = 6 (7)

So the number is 64.

E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have two expressions:

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y]
R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

First, let's consider the case where x and y are both positive integers. Then, we have:

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = x + y + x+y = 2x + 2y

R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2(x+y)

Since 2x and 2y are both positive integers, we have:

L(x,y) = 2x + 2y = 2(x+y) = R(x,y)

So, in this case, L(x,y) = R(x,y).

Now, let's consider the case where x or y (or both) are not integers. Then, we have:

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = x + y + x+y = 2x + 2y

R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2(x+y)

Since x and y are not integers, [x] and [y] are not integers, and therefore [x+y] is not an integer. So, L(x,y) is not equal to R(x,y).

Therefore, the answer is B) L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y).",D

We can start by finding the height of the electric pole in terms of the shadow it casts. Since the shadow is 10 meters, we can set up a proportion:

10 = (14/x) meters

where x is the height of the electric pole. Solving for x, we get:

x = 140 meters

C) 120 kmph
D) 70 kmph
E) 80 kmph
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The car covers a distance of x kilometers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr.
2. To cover the same distance in 10 hours, the car needs to cover x/2 kilometers in 10 hours.
3. Since the car covers x kilometers in 20 hours at a speed of 60 km/hr, it covers (x/2) kilometers in 10 hours at a speed of (60/2) km/hr.
4. We know that the speed of the car is (60/2) km/hr, which is equal to 30 km/hr.

E) 13 / 45
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

Let's say the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means that Alan's guess is incorrect, and neither Roger nor Peter cheated.

The probability that Alan guesses incorrectly is 4/5, since he has a 1/5 chance of guessing correctly. So, the probability that Alan guesses incorrectly is:

P(Alan incorrect) = 4/5

Now, we need to find the probability that Roger cheats. Since he looks at the paper of the student in front of him, the probability of him cheating is 2/3.

P(Roger cheats) = 2/3

Finally, we need to find the probability that Peter answers correctly without cheating. Since he performs the calculations and marks the answer, the probability of him answering correctly is 5/6.

P(Peter correct) = 5/6

Now, we can use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to find the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating:

P(question correct | not cheating) = P(Alan incorrect) x P(Roger cheats) x P(Peter correct)

= (4/5) x (2/3) x (5/6)

= (4/5) x (2/3) x (5/6)

= 8/15

So, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is 8/15.

A) 10 %
B) 12 %
C) 6 %
D) 8 %
E) 4 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The problem states that the difference between simple interest and compound interest at the same rate for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72.

First, let's calculate the simple interest:

Simple interest = Principal x Rate x Time
= 5000 x Rate x 2

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

Simple interest = 5000 x Rate x 2
= 5000 x x x 2
= 10,000

So, the simple interest for Rs. 5000 for 2 years at a rate of x% is Rs. 10,000.

Now, let's calculate the compound interest:

Compound interest = Principal x (1 + Rate/100)^Time
= 5000 x (1 + Rate/100)^2

Again, we can substitute the values we know:

Compound interest = 5000 x (1 + Rate/100)^2
= 5000 x (1 + x/100)^2
= 5000 x (1 + 2x/100)^2
= 5000 x (3x/100)^2
= 15,000

So, the compound interest for Rs. 5000 for 2 years at a rate of x% is Rs. 15,000.

Now, we can see that the difference between the simple interest and compound interest is:

Difference = Compound interest - Simple interest
= 15,000 - 10,000
= 5,000

So, the answer is:

The answer is B) 12%.

The rate of interest is 12% because the difference between the simple interest and compound interest for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 5,000, which is 12% of the principal amount.",B

If 50 % of the files were not infected by a virus , how many of Sam ' s files were NOT infected by a worm ?

A) 50
B) 70
C) 75
D) 100
E) 125
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.
* 50% of the files are not infected by a virus.

From the first point, we know that the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So, if x is the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, then the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x.

From the second point, we know that 50% of the files are not infected by a virus, so the number of files not infected by a virus is 50% of the total number of files.

Now, let's use these two pieces of information to set up an equation. Let's say the total number of files is x. Then, the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is x, and the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x. The number of files not infected by a virus is 50% of x, which is 0.5x.

We know that the total number of files is x, so we can set up the equation:

x + 2.5x + 0.5x = 250

Simplifying the equation:

3.5x = 250

Dividing both sides by 3.5:

x = 71

So, there are 71 files that are infected by both a virus and a worm, and 2.5 times that is 177.5 files infected only by a worm.

Now, we need to find out how many files are not infected by a worm. We know that 50% of the files are not infected by a virus, so the number of files not infected by a worm is:

0.5x = 0.5(71) = 35

Therefore, the answer is:

The number of files not infected by a worm",C

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's work this out step by step!

Let's say Mohan's share is x. Then, Sohan's share would be 5100 - x.

We know that if their shares are invested at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they will receive equal amounts when they turn 26 years old. So, we can set up the equation:

x + (4/100)x = 5100 + (4/100)(5100 - x)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x + 4x = 5100 + 4(5100 - x)

Combine like terms:

6x + 4x = 9100

10x = 9100

x = 9100/10

x = 910

So, Mohan's share is 910.

D) w / ( 3 xy)
E) 3 y / ( wx)
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, we know that the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. This means that the rate of flow is given by:

w/25 = x gallons per second

Next, we know that we want to find out how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain. To do this, we need to convert the rate of flow from gallons per second to gallons per minute. We can do this by dividing the rate of flow by the number of seconds in a minute:

w/25 = x gallons per second

x = w/25 gallons per second

Now, we can convert x to gallons per minute by dividing by the number of seconds in a minute:

x = w/25 gallons per second

x/60 = gallons per minute

Now, we know that y gallons will pass through the drain in x minutes, so we can set up the equation:

y = x \* 60

Substituting the value of x from the previous equation, we get:

y = (w/25) \* 60

Simplifying, we get:

y = w \* 60/25

Now, we can see that the answer is:

The answer is B) 20xy/w.

Therefore, it will take y gallons to pass through the drain in x minutes, where x is the number of seconds it takes for w gallons to pass through the drain.",C

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver , what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum ?
Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver, and its weight is 30 grams.
2. The diameter of the coin is 15 mm, and it is 2 mm thick.
3. The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy, we can assume that the weight of the aluminum in the coin is equal to the weight of the silver in the coin.

We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, and the weight of one gram of silver is twice the weight of one gram of aluminum. Therefore, the weight of the silver in the coin is 30 grams x 2 = 60 grams.

Now, we can find the weight of the aluminum in the coin by subtracting the weight of the silver from the total weight of the coin:

Weight of aluminum = Weight of coin - Weight of silver
= 30 grams - 60 grams
= -30 grams

Since the weight of the aluminum in the coin is negative, it means that the coin is made entirely of silver, and there is no aluminum in the coin. Therefore, there is no weight of aluminum to consider.

The answer is:

A) 30 grams

The weight of a coin made of pure aluminum would be 30 grams, since that is the weight of the coin made of the alloy of aluminum and silver.",B

Given:

* 2/3 of a number is subtracted from 10.
* The result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.

Let's start by finding 2/3 of the number.

2/3 of a number is equal to 2 x 3/2 = 6/2 = 3.

So, 2/3 of the number is 3.

Now, let's subtract 3 from 10:

10 - 3 = 7

Now, let's find the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number:

40 + (1/3) x (number) = 40 + (1/3) x (number)

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0.

First, we can factor the equation as:

x^2 - 5x + k = (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0

Now, we can see that the equation has two factors, (x - 3) and (x - 2). This means that we will have two distinct roots, one for each factor.

To find the largest integral value of k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots, we need to find the largest value of k for which both (x - 3) and (x - 2) are positive and have distinct real roots.

Let's consider the factor (x - 3). When x = 3, (x - 3) = 0, so we need to find the largest value of k for which the equation is still solvable when x = 3.

We can substitute x = 3 into the equation:

3^2 - 5(3) + k = 0

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

9 - 15 + k = 0

k = 6

So, the largest value of k for which the equation has two real and distinct roots is 6.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

At 8:00 am, Jim fills his dog's bowl with dog food. Let's say the initial amount of dog food in the bowl is x.

We know that the dog eats exactly once an hour, and at each feeding session, the dog consumes exactly 1/3 of the remaining dog food in the bowl. So, at 9:00 am, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the remaining food, which is (x - 1/3) x.

At 10:00 am, the dog has eaten another 1/3 of the remaining food, so the amount of food left in the bowl is (x - 2/3) x.

At noon, the dog has eaten 1/3 of the remaining food again, so the amount of food left in the bowl is (x - 3/3) x = (x - 1) x.

We want to find out what percent of the original food was left in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon. To do this, we can divide the amount of food left in the bowl by the original amount of food and multiply by 100.

So, the answer is:

1. 60% of the people who took the survey were women.
2. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.

We can start by finding out how many men took the survey. Since 60% of the people were women, that means 40% were men.

40% of the people who took the survey = 40/100 = 0.4 x 100 = 40

So, there were 40 men who took the survey.

Now, we know that 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars. That means 75/100 = 0.75 x 40 = 30 men preferred red cars.

A) 0.5
B) 1
C) 1.25
D) 1.5
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

We know that 40% of the soft drink is orange juice, so the amount of orange juice in one gallon of soft drink is:

40% of 1 gallon = 0.4 gallons

We also know that 60% of the soft drink is water, so the amount of water in one gallon of soft drink is:

60% of 1 gallon = 0.6 gallons

To make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add an amount of orange juice such that the total amount of orange juice plus water is equal to 60% of the total amount of soft drink.

Let's say we add x gallons of orange juice to the 0.4 gallons of orange juice already present in the soft drink. Then, the total amount of orange juice plus water will be:

0.4 gallons + x gallons + 0.6 gallons = 60% of 1 gallon

Simplifying, we get:

0.4 + x + 0.6 = 0.6

Solving for x, we get:

x = 0.2 gallons

So, to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add 0.2 gallons of orange juice to the 0.4 gallons already present in the soft drink.

Answer Choices:
A) 10
B) 11
C) 12
D) 13
E) 14
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the 3-digit number N is xyz, where x, y, and z are the digits of N.

When we divide 2272 by xyz, we get:

2272 ÷ xyz = 2272 / xyz = 2272 / (x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z)

Since the remainder is the same when we divide by 875, we know that the remainder is always 1. So, we can set up an equation:

2272 ÷ xyz = 2272 / (x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z) = 2272 / (x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z) = 1

Now, we can solve for x, y, and z.

First, we can isolate x by subtracting 2272 from both sides of the equation:

2272 / (x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z) = 1

Subtracting 2272 from both sides gives us:

(x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z) = 1

Next, we can factor the left-hand side of the equation:

(x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z) = (x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z) = (x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z) = (x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z) = 1

Since we have a factor of 1 on the left-hand side, we can see that x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z = 1.

Now, we can solve for x, y, and z.

x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z = 1

x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z = 1

x * 10^2 + y * 10 + z = ",A

C) 68 %
D) 72 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say there are x passing students and y failing students in the class. We know that the passing students have an average of 83 and the failing students have an average of 55.

The overall class average is 76, so we can set up the following equation:

(x + y)76 = (x)83 + (y)55

Now, we can simplify this equation by combining like terms:

(x + y)76 = x83 + y55

x + y = 76 - 83 + 55

x + y = 47

Now, we can solve for x by subtracting y from both sides of the equation:

x + y = 47

x = 47 - y

Now, we can find the percentage of students who passed by dividing the number of passing students by the total number of students:

(x/x + y)100 = (47/47 + 55)100

(x/x + y)100 = (47/102)100

(x/x + y)100 = 46%

So, the answer is:

C) $ 90
D) $ 97
E) $ 104
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The average wage for the fortnight (15 days) is $90 per day.
2. The average wage for the first 7 days is $87 per day.
3. The average wage for the last 7 days is $92 per day.

Now, we can set up two equations based on the information given:

Equation 1:

(7 days x $87) + (8 days x $92) = (15 days x $90)

Equation 2:

(7 days x $87) + (8 days x $92) = (7 days x $92) + (8 days x $87)

Now, let's solve Equation 2 first:

(7 days x $87) + (8 days x $92) = $609 + $736 = $1,345

Now, let's substitute the value of $1,345 into Equation 1:

(7 days x $87) + (8 days x $92) = $1,345

Now, we can solve for the wage on the 8th day:

(7 days x $87) + (1 day x $92) = $1,345

$609 + $92 = $1,345

$701 = $1,345

So, the wage on the 8th day is $701.

So, we know that the two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, and if 9 is subtracted from each, the new numbers are in the ratio 12:23.

Let's say the smaller number is x, and the larger number is 3x + 9.

Before subtracting 9, the ratio of the two numbers is:

3x : (3x + 9) = 3 : 4

Now, when we subtract 9 from each number, we get:

3x - 9 : (3x + 9) - 9 = 3 : 4

where q is the present age of Rahul.

Since Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, we know that Rahul's present age is 5 years younger than Denis's present age. So, we can write:

q = Denis's present age - 2

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

x - 6 = 18(Denis's present age - 2) + 2

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

B) 62
C) 43
D) 67
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start by finding the average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat before replacing one of the crew members. We know that the average weight is increased by 1.8 kg when the new man is added, so we can set up the following equation:

Average weight before = (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10

We know that the average weight after replacing one of the crew members is:

Average weight after = (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10 + 1.8 kg

Now, we need to find the weight of the new man. Let's call the weight of the new man x. We know that the total weight of the 10 oarsmen before replacing one of the crew members is:

Total weight before = (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10

And the total weight after replacing one of the crew members is:

Total weight after = (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10 + 1.8 kg

We can set up the following equation:

Total weight before - Total weight after = (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10 - (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10 - 1.8 kg

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0 = (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10 - (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10 - 1.8 kg

Solving for the weight of the new man, we get:

weight of new man = (10 x weight of each oarsman) / 10 - 1.8 kg

We know that the weight of each oarsman is 53 kg, so we can substitute this value into the equation:

weight of new man = (10 x 53 kg) / 10 - 1.8 kg

Simplifying, we get:

weight of new man = 530 kg - 1.8 kg

weight of new man = 528.2 kg

There are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box without selecting the ball with number 3 marked on it.

To start, we can choose the first ball in 10 different ways (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10).

For each of these choices, we can choose the second ball in 9 different ways (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), since we cannot choose the ball with number 3.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given statement:

I. Q is the square of a prime number.

If Q is the square of a prime number, then it can be written as $Q = p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that $p^2$ must have at least 5 factors. However, the only prime number with 5 factors is 5, and $5^2 = 25$. So, this option is not possible.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.

If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, then it can be written as $Q = p^4$, where $p$ is a prime number. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that $p^4$ must have at least 5 factors. However, the only prime number with 5 factors is 5, and $5^4 = 625$. So, this option is not possible either.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The problem states that the professors borrowed Rs. 5000 from the university at simple interest. After 3 years, the university received Rs. 300 on interest.

First, let's calculate the total amount that the professors owed to the university after 3 years:

Total amount owed = Rs. 5000 + (Rs. 5000 x 3 years)
= Rs. 5000 + (3 x Rs. 5000)
= Rs. 5000 + Rs. 15,000
= Rs. 20,000

Now, we know that the university received Rs. 300 on interest, so we can calculate the interest rate as follows:

Interest rate = (Rs. 300 / Rs. 20,000) x 100
= (300 / 20,000) x 100

Selling price = Cost price x (1 - Discount percentage)

In this case, the cost price of the article is Rs. 4578, and the discount percentage is 20%, so we can calculate the selling price as follows:

Selling price = Rs. 4578 x (1 - 0.20)
= Rs. 4578 x 0.80
= Rs. 3654.40

So, the actual selling price of the article was Rs. 3654.40.

E) 100 AB / 27
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, we know that 27 bottles of soda cost $A cents. This means that the cost of one bottle of soda is $A / 27.

Now, we need to find out how much B bottles will cost. We can do this by multiplying the cost of one bottle by the number of bottles:

Cost of B bottles = (A / 27) x B

Since B is a larger number than 27, we can simplify the calculation by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 27:

Cost of B bottles = (A / 27) x B
= (A / 27) x (27 x 27)
= (A / 27) x 729
= 729A / 27

Now, we can see that the answer is:

The answer is B) 27 / AB.

So, if 27 bottles of soda cost $A cents, then B bottles will cost $27 / AB cents.",A

C) 4 / 7
D) 2 / 5
E) 2 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

To determine the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of pairs of integers in S that have no common positive factors other than 1.

Let's start by listing out the first few numbers in S:

1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ..., 1000

Now, let's look for pairs of numbers in S that have no common positive factors other than 1. We can start by looking at the first few pairs:

1 and 2 have no common factors other than 1.
2 and 3 have no common factors other than 1.
3 and 4 have no common factors other than 1.
4 and 5 have no common factors other than 1.

In fact, we can see that the first 5 pairs of numbers in S all have no common positive factors other than 1. This suggests that the probability of choosing a number that is relatively prime to 1,000 is high.

To be more precise, we can calculate the probability as follows:

Probability = (number of pairs with no common factors other than 1) / (total number of pairs)

Since there are 5 pairs with no common factors other than 1 in the first 5 numbers, and there are a total of (1000 x 999) / 2 = 499,500 pairs in S, we have:

Probability = (5) / (499,500) = 1 / 999 = 0.1001

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 4 / 7.

Note that the probability is very close to 1, but not exactly 1, because there is a tiny chance that two randomly chosen numbers in S might have a common factor other than 1.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

We know that Charles received $54,080 at the end of his one-year investment, and that the investment paid an annual interest of 8% compounded semi-annually. This means that the interest was calculated twice a year, once at the beginning of the year and once at the end of the year.

We can start by calculating the interest for the first six months of the year. The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(n/2)

where A is the amount of money after n periods, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of periods per year. In this case, n is 2 (semi-annually), and r is 8%/2 = 4%.

So, the interest for the first six months is:

A = $45,000(1 + 4/2)^(2/2) = $45,000(1 + 2) = $45,000(3) = $63,000

Now we add the interest and the principal to find the total amount that Charles originally invested:

Total = $45,000 + $63,000 = $108,000

1. Joe's age, his sister's age, and their father's age sum up to 100.

So, we can write an equation based on this:

Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + their father's age = 100

2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as she is now.

So, we can write another equation based on this:

Joe's sister's age = 2(Joe's sister's current age)

3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when Joe's sister was as old as her father.

So, we can write another equation based on this:

Their father's age = 2(their father's current age)

Given:

* m > 0 (m is a positive number)
* y > 0 (y is a positive number)

We know that there is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. This means that the probability of a voter not voting is 10%.

If we choose five registered voters at random, the probability that all five vote is (1 - 10%)^5, or approximately 0.95^5 = 0.646.

The probability that exactly four of the five voters voted is therefore 1 - the probability that all five voted, which is:

If the yard has an area of 240 square meters , how many meters of fencing does she need ?
Answer Choices:
A) 58
B) 62
C) 66
D) 70
E) 74
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by identifying the dimensions of the yard. Since Alice wants to fence three sides, we know that one side will be unfenced. So, we can let the length of the unfenced side be x meters. The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters, so the area of the fenced sides must be 240 - x square meters.

The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(l + w), where l is the length of one side and w is the width of the other side. Since we're only fencing three sides, we'll use the perimeter formula for a rectangle with one side missing:

P = 2(l + w + x)

We know that the area of the fenced sides is 240 - x square meters, so the total area of the yard is:

A = 240 - x + x = 240 + x

Now we can set up an equation using the perimeter formula and the area formula:

P = 2(l + w + x) = 2(l + w + 240)

Substituting the area formula, we get:

2(l + w + 240) = 2(240 + x)

Simplifying, we get:

2l + 2w + 480 = 2x + 240

Now we can solve for l:

2l + 2w + 480 = 2x + 240

Subtracting 2w from both sides gives us:

2l + 480 = 2x + 240

Subtracting 480 from both sides gives us:

2l = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:

l = x

So, the length of the unfenced side is equal to the width of the fenced sides. Let's call the width of the fenced sides ""w"". Then we have:

l = w

Now we can find the total length of the fenced sides:

L = 2w

The area of the fenced sides is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The middle letter must be a vowel.
2. The first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonants.

So, we can start by choosing any vowel for the middle letter. There are 5 vowels in the alphabet, so we have 5 options for the middle letter: A, E, I, O, U.

Now, we need to choose two consonants for the first and third letters. There are 20 consonants in the alphabet, so we have 20 options for the first and third letters.

Since the first letter and the third letter must be different, we can choose two different consonants for the first and third letters. This means we have 20 x 19 = 380 possible combinations for the first and third letters.

However, we have already chosen the middle letter, so we need to subtract the number of combinations that have the same middle letter as the ones we have already considered. There are 5 possible middle letters, and each middle letter can be combined with 19 consonants for the first and third letters, so we need to subtract 5 x 19 = 95 combinations.

Therefore, the total number of possible combinations is 380 - 95 = 285.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

We know that the product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729.

The first integer is 727, so we can start by finding the next two consecutive integers:

727 + 1 = 728 (the second integer)
728 + 1 = 729 (the third integer)

Now we have the three consecutive integers: 727, 728, and 729.

The sum of these three integers is:

727 + 728 + 729 = 2184

Answer Choices:

B) 1200 litres
C) 12000 litres
D) 120000 litres
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The volume of the tank can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism, which is:

Volume = Length x Width x Height

In this case, the length, width, and height of the tank are 8 meters, 6 meters, and 2.5 meters, respectively.

So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:

Volume = 8 x 6 x 2.5 = ?

Now, we need to convert all the measurements to the same unit of measurement, which in this case is meters.

The volume of the tank is:

Volume = 8 x 6 x 2.5 = 8 x 6 x 2.5 = 120 cubic meters

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 12000 liters.

Note that we need to convert the volume from cubic meters to liters, which is 1 cubic meter = 1000 liters. So, we can multiply the volume in cubic meters by 1000 to get the volume in liters:

12000 cubic meters x 1000 liters/cubic meter = 12000000 liters

B) 32
C) 35
D) 36
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The worker takes 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour.
2. To cycle at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour, the worker will take longer to cover the same distance.
3. We can calculate the time it takes to cycle by dividing the distance by the average speed:

Time = Distance / Speed

Since the distance is the same as the driving distance (20 km), we can use the same distance in the calculation:

Time = 20 km / 6 km/h = 3.33 hours

4. To convert hours to minutes, we can multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time = 3.33 hours x 60 minutes/hour = 199.8 minutes

So, the worker will take approximately 199.8 minutes (or 3 hours and 19.8 minutes) to cycle from home to work along the same route at an average rate of 6 kilometers per hour.
