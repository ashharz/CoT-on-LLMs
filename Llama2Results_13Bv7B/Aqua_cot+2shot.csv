Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The car is driving in a straight line towards the base of the tower, so the angle of elevation is changing uniformly.
2. The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, which means the angle of elevation is increasing at a constant rate.
3. We know that the angle of elevation is increasing at a rate of 10 minutes for every 45° of elevation gain.
4. Therefore, the car will take 10 minutes to reach the base of the tower if it starts at a distance of 45° from the tower.
5. Since the car starts at a distance of 45° from the tower, it will take 10 minutes to reach the base of the tower.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item.
2. The discounted price of the item was 22% of the original price.
3. The customer used a $20-off coupon.
4. There is no tax on the item.

E) 315
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

We know that the trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, which means that the selling price is 100% + 20% of the cost price.

So, the selling price can be written as:

Selling price = Cost price + Profit

We also know that the selling price is Rs. 360.

So, we can set up the equation:

360 = Cost price + 20% of Cost price

Now, we can calculate the profit as a percentage of the cost price:

Profit = 20% of Cost price

Profit = 20/100 x Cost price

Profit = 0.2 x Cost price

Now, we can substitute the value of the selling price into the equation:

360 = Cost price + 0.2 x Cost price

360 = Cost price + 0.2 x 360

360 = Cost price + 72

Now, we can solve for the cost price:

Cost price = 360 - 72

Cost price = 288

C) 380
D) 400
E) 3200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start with the first pull of 20 marbles. Since all the marbles are white, the probability of pulling out a black marble is 0. Therefore, the probability of pulling out a white marble is 100%. So, out of the 20 marbles pulled out the first time, we have:

20 x 100% = 20 white marbles

Now, we know that 1 black marble was pulled out of the 20 marbles pulled out the second time. So, the probability of pulling out a black marble the second time is:

1/20 = 0.05 or 5%

Since the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag, we can conclude that:

5% of the total marbles in the bag are black

Now, let's find the total number of marbles in the bag. We know that the bag contains only white marbles, except for the 1 black marble that was painted black and put back in the bag. So, the total number of marbles in the bag is:

20 (white marbles) + 1 (black marble) = 21

Therefore, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: To form distinct bike numbers using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to choose the 2 letters and the 2 numbers independently.

Let's consider the letters first. We have 26 choices for the first letter and 26 choices for the second letter, so there are 26 x 26 = 676 possible combinations of letters.

Now, for the numbers, we have 10 choices for the first number and 10 choices for the second number, so there are 10 x 10 = 100 possible combinations of numbers.

Since we need to choose the letters and numbers independently, we multiply the number of possible combinations of letters by the number of possible combinations of numbers to get the total number of distinct bike numbers:

676 x 100 = 67600

Therefore, the answer is C) 74325. To form distinct bike numbers, we need 2 distinct letters and 2 distinct numbers, so we need 2 distinct letters out of 26 and 2 distinct numbers out of 10.</s>",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The train is running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, so it covers 1/4 of the distance in:

1/4 distance = speed x time = 100 x time

Time = 100/4 = 25 hours

2. Now, the train starts raining and the speed reduces to 75 miles/hour, so the total journey duration becomes:

Total distance = 1/4 distance + 3/4 distance

Total distance = 25 + (3/4) x (total distance)

Total distance = 25 + (3/4) x (100 x time)

Total distance = 25 + (3/4) x 100 x time

Total distance = 25 + 75 x time

Total distance = 25 + 75 x 10 = 25 + 750

Total distance = 775

3. Now, we can find the total journey duration:

Total journey duration = Total distance / Speed

Total journey duration = 775 / 75

Total journey duration = 10

B) 81
C) 90
D) 99
E) 110
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

* At least 45% of the students attended the prom night, which means that 45% of 200 is at least 90 students (since 90 is more than 45% of 200).
* At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, which means that 35% of 200 is at least 70 students (since 70 is more than 35% of 200).

Now, let's find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who attended one or both events from the total number of students.

* Students who attended prom night: 90 (minimum)
* Students who took part in the debating session: 70 (minimum)

Answer Choices:
A) 15
B) 24
C) 25
D) 40
E) 52
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let X be the number of sales the salesperson makes.

Since each sale is for $250, the total revenue from X sales is:

250 x X = 250X

The salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale, so their total income from commissions is:

10% x 250X = 25X

The salesperson's total income from both the sales and commissions is:

250X + 25X = 275X

The salesperson needs to earn at least $1000, so we set up the equation:

275X >= 1000

Now we can solve for X:

275X - 1000 = 0

X = 4

So the salesperson needs to make 4 sales of $250 each to earn a salary of at least $1000.

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit ( revenue from sales minus production costs ) will be at least $ 626,400 ?
Answer Choices:
A) 226
B) 230
C) 240
D) 260
E) 280
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

First, we know that the company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, so the total production cost per month is:

420 units x $110 per unit = $46,200 per month

Since the company sells all of the components by the end of each month, the total revenue per month is:

420 units x selling price per unit = $46,200 per month

We want the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) to be at least $626,400, so we need to find the selling price per component that will result in a yearly profit of at least $626,400.

Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost:

420 units x $110 per unit x 12 months = $5,040,000 per year

Now, we can set up an equation to find the selling price per component that will result in a yearly profit of at least $626,400:

Yearly profit = Revenue from sales - Yearly production cost

We know that the revenue from sales is equal to the total production cost per month x 12 months, so:

Yearly revenue = $46,200 per month x 12 months = $554,400 per year

Now we can substitute the values we know into the equation:

Yearly profit = $554,400 - $5,040,000 = $4,485,600

Since we want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, we can set up an inequality:

Yearly profit > $626,400

Now we can solve for the selling price per component:

$4,485,600 - $5,040,000 > $626,400

$5,040,000 - $4,485,600 > $626,400

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so 10% of 72 (the total number of staplers produced) were defective.
* 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so 2% of 72 (the number of non-defective staplers) were rejected.

We know that the number of defective staplers is 10% of 72, which is:

10% of 72 = 0.10 x 72 = 7.2

And we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected, which is:

2% of 72 = 0.02 x 72 = 1.44

So, the total number of staplers rejected is:

7.2 + 1.44 = 8.64

Now, we need to find the total number of staplers produced on Monday. To do this, we subtract the number of staplers rejected from the total number of staplers produced:

72 - 8.64 = 63.36

We know that A and B are independent events, which means that the probability of one event occurring does not affect the probability of the other event occurring.

We also know that P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8.

To find P(A/B), we can use the formula:

P(A/B) = P(A) x P(B) / P(A ∩ B)

Answer Choices:
A) ( zy – 2 x) / z
B) ( zy – 2) / z
C) ( zx – y) / ( z – 2)
D) ( zy – 2 x) / ( z - 2)
E) ( zy – x) / ( z + 2)
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The average score for the entire class is y, and the average score for the highest and lowest scorers is x. We know that the average score for the entire class is equal to the average of the highest and lowest scores, so we can set up the equation:

y = (x + y) / 2

We also know that the highest score is x, and the lowest score is y - z, so we can substitute these values into the equation above:

y = (x + (y - z)) / 2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

y = (x + y - 2z) / 2

Now, we can see that the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers is:

(zy - 2x) / (z - 2)

So, the answer is:

A) (zy - 2x) / (z - 2)

D) 5.5
E) 6.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through the problem step by step.

1. First, we need to evaluate the expression inside the parentheses:

5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7

We know that ? is a variable, so we can substitute any value for it. Let's try a few values to see how the expression changes:

* If ? = 2, then the expression becomes:

5 + 2 × 19 - 15 - 7
= 5 + 38 - 15 - 7
= 5 + 20 - 22
= 13

* If ? = 3, then the expression becomes:

5 + 3 × 19 - 15 - 7
= 5 + 57 - 15 - 7
= 5 + 45 - 22
= 18

* If ? = 4, then the expression becomes:

5 + 4 × 19 - 15 - 7
= 5 + 76 - 15 - 7
= 5 + 64 - 22
= 23

As we can see, the value of the expression changes depending on the value of ?.

2. Next, we need to simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

13 × 13 - 156

We can simplify this expression by multiplying 13 and 13, then subtracting 156:

13 × 13 = 169
169 - 156 = 13

So the expression inside the parentheses is equal to 13.

3. Now we can set up the equation:

[5 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] / 13 = 6

We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation by substituting the value of the expression inside the parentheses:

[13 + ? × 19 - 15 - 7] / 13 = 6

We can simplify the right-hand side of the equation by dividing both sides by 13:

13 + ? × 19 - 15 - ",C

C) 24
D) 30
E) 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour. This means that for every bag of flour sold, the grocer earns a profit of 25% of the selling price.
2. The grocer sells each bag of flour for $100, so the selling price is $100.
3. The grocer makes a total profit of $3,000 on the sale of the bags of flour. This means that the total profit from all the bags sold is $3,000.
4. Since the profit is 25% of the selling price, we can set up the equation:

Profit = 0.25 x Selling Price

Substituting the values we know, we get:

Profit = 0.25 x $100

Profit = $25

5. Since the total profit is $3,000, we can set up the equation:

$3,000 = 0.25 x Selling Price

Solving for the selling price, we get:

Selling Price = $3,000 / 0.25

Selling Price = $12,000

6. Since the grocer sells each bag for $100, we can calculate the number of bags sold by dividing the selling price by the price per bag:

Number of Bags = Selling Price / Price per Bag

Number of Bags = $12,000 / $100

Number of Bags = 120

The answer is C) 120 bags.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the problem step by step:

1. Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy, so he makes 35 toys in 7 hours, which means he makes 35/7 = 5 toys per hour.
2. Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy, so he makes 35 toys in 9 hours, which means he makes 35/9 = 4 toys per hour.
3. Since both Alex and Jacob have worked for almost similar number of hours, we can assume that they have worked for the same number of hours, let's call it x hours.
4. Alex makes 5 toys per hour, so he makes 5x toys in x hours.
5. Jacob makes 4 toys per hour, so he makes 4x toys in x hours.
6. Since they have worked for the same number of hours, the total number of toys made by Alex and Jacob is the same: 35.
7. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 5x + 4x = 35.
8. Simplifying the equation: 9x = 35.
9. Solving for x: x = 35/9 = 4.

The answer is:

C) 17

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. First, we know that John replaces 15% of the 50% strong milk tea with milk, so he replaces 15% of 50% = 0.5 x 0.15 = 7.5% of the original solution with milk.
2. Next, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution with more milk, so he replaces 10% of the new solution = 0.10 x (1 - 0.5) = 0.10 x 0.5 = 5% of the new solution with milk.
3. Now, we need to calculate the final concentration of tea that John drinks. To do this, we need to find the percentage of the original solution that is not milk.
4. The original solution was 50% strong milk tea, so the percentage of the solution that is not milk is 50% - 15% - 5% = 30%.
5. Therefore, the final concentration of tea that John drinks is 30% of the original solution = 30% x 50% = 15%.

1/16 of the students study math, so there are 16x math students.
1/10 of the students study bio, so there are 10x bio students.
1/8 of the students study english, so there are 8x english students.

We know that the total number of students is a 4-digit number, so let's start by finding the maximum number of students.

The retailer sold the appliance for 40% above cost, which means the selling price is:

Selling price = Cost + (Cost x 40%)

Selling price = Cost + (0.4 x Cost)

Selling price = Cost + 0.4 x Cost

Selling price = 1.4 x Cost

Since the gross profit is $20, and it represents 40% of the cost, we can set up the following equation:

0.4 x Cost = $20

Now, we can solve for Cost:

Cost = $20 / 0.4

Cost = $50

So, the retailer sold the appliance for:

Selling price = $50 + $20 (gross profit)

Selling price = $50 + $20

Selling price = $70

Answer Choices:
A) 750
B) 700
C) 620
D) 600
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

1. The principal amount borrowed is Rs. 500.
2. The interest rate is 6% per annum, which means the interest rate per year is 6/100 = 0.06.
3. The time period is 4 years, so we need to calculate the interest for each year and add them up.
4. The formula to calculate the interest is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

Now, let's calculate the interest for each year:

Year 1:
Interest = Rs. 500 x 0.06 x 1 = Rs. 30

Year 2:
Interest = Rs. 500 x 0.06 x 2 = Rs. 60

Year 3:
Interest = Rs. 500 x 0.06 x 3 = Rs. 90

Year 4:
Interest = Rs. 500 x 0.06 x 4 = Rs. 120

Now, let's add up all the interests:

Total Interest = Rs. 30 + Rs. 60 + Rs. 90 + Rs. 120 = Rs. 300

So, the total amount that Rahul needs to pay to clear the debt after 4 years is:

So, the original retail price of the appliance was 60% more than its wholesale cost, which means the retail price was:

Retail price = Wholesale cost x 1.6

Now, the appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which means the sale price was:

Sale price = Retail price x 0.8

We know that the wholesale cost was $100, so we can substitute that in:

Sale price = $100 x 1.6 x 0.8

Simplifying, we get:

Sale price = $100 x 1.28

B) 1120
C) 792
D) 1320
E) 1200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the problem. We know that the rectangular sheet has a perimeter of 48 cm when folded along one set of sides, and a perimeter of 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides. This means that the length of the sheet must be the same for both folds, since the perimeter of a rectangle is equal to 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.

Let's call the length of the sheet x. Then we can write the perimeter of the sheet when folded along one set of sides as:

48 = 2(x + w)

Similarly, we can write the perimeter of the sheet when folded along the other set of sides as:

66 = 2(x + w)

Now we can solve for x by subtracting the first equation from the second:

66 - 48 = 2(x + w) - 2(x + w)

This simplifies to:

18 = 2w

Now we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for w:

9 = w

Now we know that the length of the sheet is x + w = x + 9, and the width is w = 9.

The area of the sheet is given by the product of the length and width:

Area = x + 9 x 9 = 99

The rectangular solid has dimensions 3 x 4 x 15, so its volume is 3 x 4 x 15 = 120.

Since the solid is inscribed in a sphere, the sphere must have the same volume as the solid. Therefore, the volume of the sphere is also 120.

The diameter of a sphere is the distance across the sphere passing through its center. Since all eight vertices of the solid are on the sphere, the diameter must pass through all eight vertices.

Let's draw a circle passing through all eight vertices. Since the circle passes through the center of the sphere, it must be the diameter of the sphere.

The length of the diameter of the circle is the distance between two opposite vertices, which is 3 + 4 + 15 = 22.

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 22.

Answer Choices:
A) Rs . 697.50
B) Rs . 712.50
C) Rs . 787.50
D) Rs . 750
E) Rs . 780
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given that the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5% and earns Rs. 15 less as profit, we can let the marked price of the watch be x. Then, the selling price after a 5% discount is:

x - (5% of x) = x - 0.05x = x - 0.05x

Since the shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit, we can set up the equation:

x - (5% of x) = Rs. 15 less

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

x - (5% of x) = Rs. 15 less

x - 0.05x = Rs. 15

Now, we can simplify the equation:

0.05x = Rs. 15

x = Rs. 15 / 0.05

x = Rs. 300

So, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 300.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given that the student found the value of 7/18 of the number, we know that the actual value of 7/8 of the number is 7/18 times the number.

So, if the student's answer was x, then the actual answer would be 7/18x.

We know that the difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is 770. So, we can set up the equation:

7/18x - x = 770

Simplifying the equation:

18x - 7x = 770

B) $ 40000
C) $ 30000
D) $ 20000
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. The fixed salary of the shop assistant is $500, so we know that the monthly salary (S) is:

S = $500 + (5% of monthly sales)

2. We want the monthly salary to be $1500, so we can set up an equation:

S = $1500

3. We know that the fixed salary is $500, so we can subtract that from the total monthly salary:

S - $500 = $1500

4. Now we can solve for the monthly sales:

$1500 - $500 = $1000

5. Since the monthly sales are 5% of the total monthly salary, we can find the monthly sales by multiplying the total monthly salary by 0.05:

$1000 x 0.05 = $50

6. Therefore, the monthly sales should be:

$1000 + $50 = $1050

B) 562
C) 458
D) 156
E) 452
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The plane flies along the four sides of a square, so it covers four sides of equal length.
2. The speeds of the plane are 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr.
3. Since the plane flies along the four sides, it covers the same distance on each side.
4. Therefore, the total distance covered by the plane is four times the length of one side.
5. The length of one side of the square is half the circumference of the square, since the square is a regular shape.
6. The circumference of a square is equal to the length of the side times four.
7. Therefore, the total distance covered by the plane is four times the length of one side, which is equal to the circumference of the square.
8. Now, we can set up an equation based on the information given:

Total distance = 4 x (length of one side)

Substituting the values given in the problem:

Total distance = 4 x (half the circumference)

Total distance = 4 x (4 x side length)

Total distance = 4 x 4 x side length

Total distance = 16 x side length

9. Since the plane covers the same distance on each side, the distance covered on each side is 16 x side length.
10. Therefore, the average speed of the plane around the field is:

Average speed = total distance / time taken

Average speed = 16 x side length / time taken

Given that the plane flies at speeds of 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr, we can set up an equation for the time taken:

Time taken = distance / speed

Substituting the values given in the problem:

Time taken = 16 x side length / (200, 400, 600, 800)

Time taken = 16 x side length / (2, 4, 6, 8)

Time taken = 16 x side length / 24

Time taken = side length

D) 24567
E) 43566
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 76523.

Let's analyze the given information:

1. With a 1 after the number, the number becomes three times as large.
2. The number has 5 digits.

We can start by assuming that the number is xxxxx, where x is a digit.

If we add 1 to the number, we get xxxxx + 1 = xxxxx + 10.

Since the number becomes three times as large, we can write:

xxxxx + 1 = 3(xxxx)

Now, we can simplify the equation:

x + 1 = 3x

Subtracting x from both sides gives:

1 = 2x

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

x = 35

So, the number is 35xxxx.

Now, we need to find the last digit of the number. Since the number has 5 digits, the last digit can be any of the digits from 0 to 9. However, since the number becomes three times as large when we add 1, the last digit must be 3, 6, 9, or 8 (since these digits are the multiples of 3).

Therefore, the last digit of the number is 8.

Now, let's call the time it takes for the second car to travel 50 miles ""t + 1"". Since the second car is traveling at 13 mph, we know that:

t + 1 = 50 / 13 = 3.84 hours

Since the cars start at the same time, we know that the difference between their travel times is the time it takes for the second car to catch up to the first car:

t + 1 - t = 3.84 - 4 = 0.84 hours

Therefore, the answer is:

So, the man borrows Rs. 360 and pays it back in 12 monthly installments of Rs. 31.50 each. We can start by calculating the total amount paid by the borrower over the 12 months:

12 monthly installments x Rs. 31.50 per month = Rs. 378

So, the total amount paid by the borrower is Rs. 378. Now, we can calculate the interest paid by the borrower over the 12 months:

Total amount paid - Principal amount = Interest paid
Rs. 378 - Rs. 360 = Rs. 18

So, the interest paid by the borrower over the 12 months is Rs. 18. Now, we can calculate the interest rate:

Interest paid / Principal amount = Interest rate
Rs. 18 / Rs. 360 = 0.05

So, the interest rate is 5%.

So, the price of the product is reduced by 30%, which means we need to find 30% of the original price.

30% of $100 = 30/100 x $100 = $30

So, the reduced price is $100 - $30 = $70.

Now, to make the price 100%, we need to add the original price to the reduced price.

$70 + $100 = $170

So, the price should be increased by 100% - $70 = 30% to make it 100%.

C) 400
D) 487
E) 286
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure, let's solve this problem step by step!

Let's start by using the fact that the total amount of money in the pouch is Rs. 700.

Since there are 25 paise coins, we can use the fact that 25 paise = Rs. 0.25 to find out how many 25 paise coins we can buy with Rs. 700:

Rs. 700 / Rs. 0.25 = 2800

So, there are 2800 25 paise coins.

Now, let's find out how many 50 paise coins we can buy with Rs. 700:

Rs. 700 / Rs. 0.50 = 1400

So, there are 1400 50 paise coins.

Finally, we can find out how many one rupee coins we can buy with Rs. 700:

Rs. 700 / Rs. 1.00 = 700

So, there are 700 one rupee coins.

The answer is:

A) 453

Here's how we got this answer:

* 2800 25 paise coins x Rs. 0.25 = Rs. 700
* 1400 50 paise coins x Rs. 0.50 = Rs. 700
* 700 one rupee coins x Rs. 1.00 = Rs. 700

Total number of coins = 2800 + 1400 + 700 = 453.",C

C) 190 minutes
D) 70 minutes
E) 35 minutes
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

So, Train A leaves the station every 16 minutes, and Train B leaves every 17 minutes. This means that the difference between their departure times is:

17 - 16 = 1 minute

Since both trains left the station simultaneously, we can say that the next time they will leave the station simultaneously is when Train A has completed one cycle and Train B has completed two cycles.

To complete one cycle, Train A takes 16 minutes, and Train B takes 17 minutes, so we need to add:

16 + 17 = 33 minutes

Therefore, the next time both trains will leave the station simultaneously is after 33 minutes.

The answer is:

C) 190 minutes

Since 33 minutes is the difference between the departure times of the two trains, and 190 is the total number of minutes in 33 cycles of both trains.",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The hollow cube of size 5 cm has a volume of 5^3 = 125 cubic centimeters.
2. Since the thickness of the cube is 1 cm, the volume of the smaller cubes is 1^3 = 1 cubic centimeter.
3. Since the cube is made of smaller cubes, the number of smaller cubes needed to fill the hollow cube is 125 / 1 = 125 cubes.
4. Since each smaller cube has a surface area of 6 square centimeters (since it is a cube of size 1 cm), the total surface area of all the smaller cubes is 125 x 6 = 750 square centimeters.
5. Since the outer surface of the cube is painted, the surface area of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is the total surface area minus the surface area of the outer surface, which is 750 - 500 = 250 square centimeters.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. We know that 10% of the chocolates are cocoa flavored, so there are 10% of 100 = 10 chocolates that are cocoa flavored.
2. We also know that 90% of the remaining chocolates are squashed, so there are 90% of 900 = 810 chocolates that are not cocoa flavored and are squashed.
3. Therefore, the total number of chocolates that are not squashed is 10 + 810 = 820.
4. Since all chocolates are either vanilla or cocoa flavored, we know that the number of vanilla flavored chocolates is 820 - 10 = 810.
5. Finally, we can calculate the percentage of chocolates that are both vanilla flavored and not squashed by dividing the number of vanilla flavored chocolates by the total number of chocolates:

(810 / 820) x 100 = 98.8%

C) 41
D) 67
E) 44
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The question states that the sum of 5 consecutive two-digit odd numbers divided by 10 is a perfect square. We know that a perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer, so we need to find a number that can be expressed as $n^2$ for some integer $n$.

Since the numbers are consecutive, we know that the first number is odd, so it must be of the form $2n-1$ for some integer $n$. Therefore, the sum of these 5 numbers is:

$$5(2n-1) = 10n - 5$$

Now, we need to find a perfect square that is equal to $10n - 5$. Let's try a few values of $n$ to see if we can find one that works:

$$10n - 5 = 10(2n-1) = 20n - 10$$

We can see that $20n - 10$ is not a perfect square for any integer $n$.

However, we can try $n=3$ and see if it works:

$$10(3) - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25$$

Ah ha! $25$ is a perfect square (the square of 5).

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 41.

E) None of the above
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

R is as much younger than Q as Q is older than T.

We know that the sum of R and T's ages is 50 years.

Let's assume R's age is x years, then T's age is 50 - x years.

Since R is as much younger than Q as Q is older than T, we can say that:

x - T's age = Q's age

Now we can substitute T's age with 50 - x, since we know that T's age is 50 - x years:

x - (50 - x) = Q's age

Simplifying the equation:

2x = Q's age

Now we know that Q's age is twice T's age, so we can say that:

Q's age = 2(50 - x)

Substituting T's age with 50 - x:

Q's age = 2(50 - x)

Now we can simplify the equation:

Q's age = 2(50) - 2x

Simplifying further:

Q's age = 100 - 2x

Now we can see that the difference between R and Q's age is:

R's age - Q's age = x - (100 - 2x)

Simplifying:

R's age - Q's age = x - 98

Now we can see that the difference between R and Q's age is x - 98.

The answer is:

The difference between R and Q's age is x - 98.

1. The first quarter mile costs $3.50, so the first quarter mile costs $3.50.
2. The next quarter mile costs $10 (10 cents per quarter mile) + $3.50 (cost of the first quarter mile) = $13.50.
3. The next quarter mile costs $10 + $13.50 = $23.50.
4. The next quarter mile costs $10 + $23.50 = $33.50.

1. Sachin's current batting average is 51.
2. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, so his new batting average becomes:

51 + (78/100) = 51 + 0.78 = 54

3. Since his new batting average is 54, we can find out the total number of matches played by Sachin in this season by using the formula:

Batting Average = (Total Runs Scored / Total Number of Matches Played)

Given that Sachin scored 78 runs in the finals, we can find out the total number of matches played by him:

Total Runs Scored = 78

We know that Sachin's new batting average is 54, so we can use the formula to find out the total number of matches played:

54 = (Total Runs Scored / Total Number of Matches Played)

Now, we can solve for the total number of matches played:

Total Number of Matches Played = 54 / 78 = 10

Therefore, the answer is D) 10.

* The rectangular piece has an area of 150 sq m.
* The length is 1 m more than 4 times the breadth.

We can start by finding the breadth of the rectangular piece. Since the area is 150 sq m, the breadth must be:

150 sq m / (4 x breadth) = 150 sq m / 4 = breadth = 37.5 m

Now, we can find the length of the rectangular piece:

Length = 4 x breadth + 1
= 4 x 37.5 + 1
= 150 m

Now, we can find the perimeter of the rectangular piece:

Perimeter = 2 x (length + breadth)
= 2 x (150 + 37.5)
= 2 x 187.5
= 375 m

C) 12.5
D) 14.5
E) 16.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

We know that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

To find out how much of the health food we need to eat to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to first find out how much of each vitamin is present in one gram of the health food.

Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is x grams and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is y grams.

We know that one gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E, so the amount of vitamin E in one gram is:

9% of x = 0.09x

Similarly, we know that one gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A, so the amount of vitamin A in one gram is:

8% of y = 0.08y

Now, we need to find out how much of the health food we need to eat to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins. We can do this by setting up a system of linear equations using the amounts of vitamins E and A in one gram of the health food.

Let's say we need to eat x grams of the health food to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and y grams to meet the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.

We can write this as:

0.09x + 0.08y = 51

where 51 is the total amount of vitamins E and A in one gram of the health food.

Now, we need to solve this system of equations to find out how much of the health food we need to eat to meet the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.

Can you solve this system of equations and find the answer?",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Total number of cakes needed = 20 large cakes + 700 small cakes = 720 cakes
2. Each large cake takes 2 hours to prepare, so we need 20 large cakes to take 4 hours (2 x 20 = 40 hours)
3. Each small cake takes 35 minutes to prepare, so we need 700 small cakes to take 255 hours (35 x 700 = 24,500 minutes / 60 = 255 hours)
4. Total preparation time = 40 hours (large cakes) + 255 hours (small cakes) = 305 hours
5. Since the kitchen is available for 3 hours, we need to divide the total preparation time by the available time to determine the number of helpers required

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by using the fact that U is the midpoint of ST. This means that U is equidistant from both S and T.

We know that the length of ST is 22, so the distance between S and T is 22/2 = 11.

Now, we can draw a right triangle with vertices at R, S, and T. The length of RS is 5, so the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is 11 (half of the length of ST).

Since U is the midpoint of ST, it is also the midpoint of the hypotenuse of the right triangle. Therefore, the length of RU is half of the length of the hypotenuse, which is half of 11.

C) 25 %
D) 33 %
E) 18 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, the shopkeeper had a discount of 20% on all items for one day, which means that if an item originally cost $100, it would have been sold for $80 (20% of $100).

Now, the shopkeeper wants to sell the items at the original price the next day. This means that he needs to increase the price of each item by the amount of the discount, which was 20%.

So, to find the new price of an item that originally cost $100, we can multiply the original price by 1 + (20%/100), which is:

$100 x 1 + (20/100) = $100 x 1 + 2 = $100 x 1.2 = $120

Therefore, the new price of the item is $120.

To find the percentage increase, we can divide the new price by the original price and multiply by 100:

($120 / $100) x 100 = 120%

So, the answer is:

The answer is 20%.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the information given in the problem:

1. The bus fare for two persons traveling between Agra and Aligarh is four-thirds the train fare for one person.
2. The total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train between the two places is Rs. 1512.

Now, let's use this information to find the train fare for one person. We know that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, so we can start by finding the train fare for one person.

Let's assume that the train fare for one person is x. Then, the bus fare for two persons would be four-thirds of x, or 4/3x.

We also know that the total fare paid by 6 persons traveling by bus and 8 persons traveling by train is Rs. 1512. So, we can set up the following equation:

4/3x + 8x = 1512

Simplifying the equation, we get:

4x + 8x = 1212

12x = 1212

x = 100

In this case, the length of the rectangle is 8 centimeters and the width is 3 centimeters. So, we can calculate the perimeter as follows:

Perimeter = 2 x (length + width)
= 2 x (8 + 3)
= 2 x 11
= 22 cm

Therefore, the answer is B) 22 cm.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we have a straight picket fence composed of x pickets, each of which is 1/2 inch wide. There are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets. We need to find the length of the fence in feet.

First, let's think about the total width of the fence. Since each picket is 1/2 inch wide, the total width of the fence is x pickets times 1/2 inch per picket, which is:

x/2 inches

Now, we know that there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets, so we need to subtract the space between each pair of pickets from the total width of the fence:

x/2 - 6 inches

Now, we need to convert the length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:

x/2 - 6 = (x/2) x 12/12 = x/6

Now, we have the length of the fence in feet:

x/6 feet

So, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The ship travels 180 miles, so the distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles.
2. The plane starts with 10 times the speed of the ship, so the speed of the plane is 10 x 180 = 1800 miles per hour.
3. The time taken by the plane to cover the distance traveled by the ship is 1800 / 180 = 10 hours.
4. The distance traveled by the plane in 10 hours is 1800 x 10 = 18,000 miles.
5. The total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is the sum of their distances traveled, which is 180 + 18,000 = 18,180 miles.

C) 5000
D) 6000
E) 7500
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned in 2001, and 500 deer were caught at random in 2002. Of the 500 deer caught in 2002, 20 had tags from the previous year.

Let's call the total deer population in the forest at the beginning of 2002 ""x"". Since 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned in 2001, the deer population after 2001 is x - 300.

We know that 20 of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year, so the number of deer with tags in 2002 is 20/500 = 0.04 x.

Since the percent of deer in the forest with tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, we can set up the following equation:

0.04x = 20/500 = 0.04(x - 300)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.04x = 0.04(x - 300)

Solving for x, we get:

x = 4(x - 300)

x = 4(5000 - 300)

x = 4(4700)

x = 18,800

So, the total deer population in the forest at the beginning of 2002 was 18,800.

C) 0.6
D) 0.65
E) 1.5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The main line service starts at 5 o'clock, so the first train on the main line starts at 5:00 AM.
2. The harbor line starts at 5:02 AM, so the first train on the harbor line starts 2 minutes after the first train on the main line.
3. The man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes.

Now, let's consider the possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: The man catches the first train on the main line (5:00 AM). This is possible if the man arrives at the station before 5:00 AM.

Scenario 2: The man catches the first train on the harbor line (5:02 AM). This is possible if the man arrives at the station at or after 5:02 AM.

Since the man goes to the station every day to catch the first train that comes, the probability of catching the first train is the sum of the probabilities of Scenario 1 and Scenario 2.

The probability of Scenario 1 is 0.5 (since the train starts at 5:00 AM and the man has to arrive before that), and the probability of Scenario 2 is 0.5 (since the train starts at 5:02 AM and the man has to arrive at or after that).

Therefore, the probability of the man catching the first train is:

0.5 + 0.5 = 1

So, the answer is:

A) 0.9

C) 50 %
D) 65 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The population of Boomtown is currently x.
2. The population is expected to increase by 10% per year for the next two years.
3. After one year, the population will be x + 10% of x = x + 0.1x = 1.1x.
4. After two years, the population will be 1.1x + 10% of 1.1x = 1.1x + 0.1(1.1x) = 2.2x.
5. Since the population two years from now is expected to be exactly double the population of one year ago, we can set up the equation:

2.2x = 2x

Solving for x, we get:

x = 1.1

So, the population of Boomtown one year ago is 1.1.

Now, we can find the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year by dividing the change in population by the original population:

Percent population increase = (2.2x - 1.1x) / 1.1x = 10%

C) 352
D) 412
E) 456
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

We know that the greatest common factor (GCF) of two positive integers is 11, and the least common multiple (LCM) of these two integers is 7700. This means that both integers must be divisible by 11, and their LCM must be equal to 7700.

Let's assume that one of the integers is x. Then, we can write the equation:

x × y = 7700

Since the GCF is 11, we know that both x and y must be divisible by 11. Therefore, we can write:

x = 11a and y = 11b

where a and b are integers.

Substituting these expressions into the equation above, we get:

11a × 11b = 7700

Expanding the product, we get:

12ab = 7700

Since 12 is a multiple of 12, we know that ab must be equal to 640. Therefore, we can write:

a = 64 and b = 12

Now we can find the other integer by substituting these values into the equation:

x = 11a = 11(64) = 704

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) 56
B) 58
C) 60
D) 62
E) 64
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we have a square piece of cloth that is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, which means the length of the trimmed edge is 4 feet. The area of each of the two triangles formed is 70 square feet, so we can set up the following equation:

Area of each triangle = (base x height) = (4 x height)

Since there are two triangles, we need to double the equation:

2 x (4 x height) = 2 x 70

Simplifying, we get:

8 x height = 140

Dividing both sides by 8, we get:

height = 17

Now, we can find the perimeter of the original square cloth. Since each triangle has a height of 17, the perimeter of each triangle is:

Perimeter of each triangle = 2 x (base + height) = 2 x (4 + 17) = 2 x 21 = 42

Since there are two triangles, the total perimeter of the original square cloth is:

Total perimeter = 2 x perimeter of each triangle = 2 x 42 = 84

The answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) 20
B) 30
C) 40
D) 200
E) None
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 40.

Let's analyze the given information:

M = abc is a three-digit number, and N = cba.

We know that M > N, so we can write:

abc > cba

Now, we are given that M - N + 396c = 990. Expanding and simplifying, we get:

abc - cba + 396c = 990

abc - cba = 990 - 396c

Since M is a three-digit number, we know that abc is greater than 100. Therefore, we can subtract 396c from both sides of the equation without going negative:

abc - cba > 990 - 396c

Simplifying, we get:

abc - cba > 604

Since M is greater than N, we know that abc is greater than cba. Therefore, we can subtract cba from both sides of the equation:

abc - cba > 604

Simplifying, we get:

abc > 604

Now, we know that M is a three-digit number, so we can write:

abc = 100a + 10b + c

where a, b, and c are digits.

Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:

100a + 10b + c > 604

Simplifying, we get:

a > 60, b > 6, and c > 4

Therefore, there are 40 possible values of M that are greater than 300, since:

a can take 4 values (40, 50, 60, 70),
b can take 6 values (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11), and
c can take 4 values (4, 5, 6, 7)

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let x be the number of students in the school.

We know that 20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 20% of x, which is 0.2x.

Similarly, 28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 28% of x, which is 0.28x.

We also know that the total number of students is x.

Now, we can set up two equations:

0.2x + 0.28x = x (since 20% + 28% = 100%)

0.48x = x

Solving for x, we get:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's think step by step to find the answer.

First, we need to place Susan on one of the three chairs. There are 3 possible choices for the first chair:

1. Tim sits on the first chair, leaving the second and third chairs empty.
2. Zen sits on the first chair, leaving the second chair empty and Tim on the third chair.
3. Susan sits on the first chair, leaving the second and third chairs empty.

In each of these cases, there is only one way to place the remaining two children on the remaining two chairs, so there are 3 possible arrangements for the first chair.

Now, let's consider the second chair. There are two possible choices for the second chair:

1. Tim sits on the second chair, leaving the first and third chairs empty.
2. Zen sits on the second chair, leaving the first chair empty and Tim on the third chair.

In each of these cases, there is only one way to place the remaining child on the third chair, so there are 2 possible arrangements for the second chair.

Therefore, the total number of possible arrangements for the three children on the three chairs is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. In the first month, 540 calls were made, and the bill was Rs. 1800.
2. In the second month, 620 calls were made, and the bill became Rs. 2040.
3. In the third month, 500 calls were made due to more holidays.

Now, let's analyze the pattern of the bills:

1. The first month's bill is Rs. 1800.
2. The second month's bill is Rs. 2040, which is Rs. 240 more than the first month's bill.
3. The third month's bill is Rs. 1560, which is Rs. 240 less than the second month's bill.

Maximum number of hardcover books = 30
Maximum number of fiction books = 20

Now, we can find the maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction:

Maximum number of books that are both hardcover and fiction = min(30, 20)

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week.
2. The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week.
3. The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers.

Now, let's think about how many papers the hotel orders each day:

Sunday: Hotel orders 2 times the number of papers it orders on other days, so it orders 2 x (number of papers on other days) = 2 x 1 = 2 papers on Sunday.

Monday: The hotel orders 1 paper on Monday, since it's not Sunday.

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 45.

The hotel orders 2 papers on Sunday (at $4 each) and 1 paper on Monday (at $1), for a total of 2 x $4 + $1 = $8 + $1 = $9. The total cost for the week is $9 x 7 = $63. Subtracting the cost of the papers on Monday ($1) from the total cost gives us $62, which is the amount the hotel pays for papers on the other days of the week. Therefore, the hotel orders 45 papers on Monday (62 - 1 = 61, divided by $4 per paper = 45 papers).",A

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let x be the number of friends who attended the picnic. Since four of them did not show up, the number of friends who did not attend is 4.

The total amount spent on eatables is Rs 96, so the amount each person had to contribute is:

Rs 96 / (x + 4) = Rs 96 / (x + 4)

Since the four friends who did not show up did not contribute any money, the amount each of the remaining friends had to contribute is:

Rs 96 / (x + 4) = Rs 96 / (x) + Rs 4

Now, we can set up an equation:

Rs 96 / (x) + Rs 4 = Rs 96

Solving for x, we get:

x = 8

Answer Choices:

C) 25
D) 26
E) 27
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let the youngest member's age be x. Then, the next member's age would be x + 3, and the next one after that would be x + 6, and so on.

We know that the sum of the ages of all the members is 250, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x + 6) + ... + (x + 2(n-1)) = 250

where n is the number of members in the club.

Since the youngest member is 7 years old, we can start by adding up the ages of the first n members:

x + 3 + 6 + ... + 2(n-1) = 250

We can simplify this equation by noticing that each term after the first one is 3 more than the previous term:

x + 3 + 6 + ... + 2(n-1) = 3(1 + 2 + ... + n-1)

Now, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to simplify the equation further:

3(1 + 2 + ... + n-1) = 3(n(n-1)/2)

Since n is the number of members in the club, we know that n is a positive integer. Therefore, we can substitute n for n(n-1)/2 in the previous equation:

3(n(n-1)/2) = 250

Now, we can solve for n:

n(n-1)/2 = 250

n^2 - n - 250 = 0

We can factor this equation:

(n - 12)(n + 20) = 0

Now, we can see that n - 12 cannot be equal to 0, since that would imply that n is 12. Therefore, we can set n = 20:

n = 20

So, there are 20 members in the club.

So, Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200. This means he wants to sell it for a price that is 20% higher than the cost price.

First, let's calculate the cost price of the sewing machine:

Rs. 1200 x 100% = Rs. 1200

Now, we need to calculate the selling price of the sewing machine. To do this, we'll multiply the cost price by 1.2 (which is the factor we need to get a 20% increase):

Rs. 1200 x 1.2 = Rs. 1440

So, the selling price of the sewing machine should be Rs. 1440.

The answer is:

B) 1,875

This is because Rs. 1440 is the selling price of the sewing machine, and Rs. 1200 is the cost price.",E

D) 2 pm on the next day
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's solve this problem step by step.

Let's first find the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. We know that Train A leaves Mumbai Central at 11 am and runs at a speed of 40 kmph, so it will cover the distance in:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = (Lucknow - Mumbai Central) / 40

Time = (500 km) / 40

Time = 12.5 hours

Now, Train B leaves Mumbai Central at 2 pm and runs at a speed of 72 kmph, so it will cover the distance in:

Time = Distance / Speed

Time = (Lucknow - Mumbai Central) / 72

Time = (500 km) / 72

Time = 7 hours

Now, we need to find the time at which the two trains meet. We know that Train A takes 12.5 hours to reach Lucknow, and Train B takes 7 hours to reach Lucknow, so the two trains will meet when Train A has traveled for:

12.5 hours + 7 hours = 19.5 hours

Therefore, the two trains will meet at:

19.5 hours after Train A's departure time

19.5 hours after 11 am

11 am + 19.5 hours = 20:19 hours (2:19 PM)

So, Mark tells John that if he gives him half of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that Mark has half of John's money, so John has the other half.

Now, John says that if Mark gives him one third of his money, he will have Rs. 75. This means that one third of John's money is Rs. 75.

Since John has half of his money, he has two thirds of his money left. So, two thirds of John's money is:

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the information given:

x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days.

We can start by assuming that y men working y hours per day can do y units of work in y days.

Since x and y are different, we can set up a proportion to compare the two situations:

x units of work / x hours = y units of work / y hours

We know that x hours is equal to y hours, so we can simplify the proportion to:

x units of work / x = y units of work / y

Now, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

x \* x = y \* y

x^2 = y^2

Since x and y are both positive, we know that x^2 and y^2 are both positive. Therefore, we can take the square root of both sides:

x = ±y

This means that x and y are either both positive or both negative. If x and y are both positive, then the answer is:

The answer is x^2 / y^2 units.

If x and y are both negative, then the answer is:

The answer is -x^2 / -y^2 units.

However, since we are given that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days, we know that x is a positive number. Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is x^2 / y^2 units.

So, the answer is A) x^2 / y^2 units.",B

If B bisects minor arc AC , then what is the measure of minor arc AD ?
Answer Choices:
A) 80 °
B) 130 °
C) 140 °
D) 160 °
E) 220 °
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 140°.

Let's start by using the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. Since Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference of a circle, we can draw a circle with these three points as its vertices.

We know that minor arc AC is 160°, so we can draw an arc from Point A to Point C with a measure of 160°.

Since Point B bisects minor arc AC, we know that Point B must be located on the arc AC. Therefore, we can draw a line from Point B to Point C, and this line will divide the arc AC into two parts of equal measure.

Since the measure of minor arc AD is the difference between the measure of the entire arc AC and the measure of the arc BC, we can set up the following equation:

Minor arc AD = 160° - 150° = 10°

So, the measure of minor arc AD is 10°.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The fan blade is rotating in a plane 10 centimeters from the center of the fan.
2. The fan runs at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute.
3. We need to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade after 30 seconds.

Now, let's convert the rate of revolutions per minute to revolutions per second:

300 revolutions/minute x (1 revolution/minute) / (1000 revolutions/second) = 300 / 1000 = 0.3 revolutions/second

Now, we can use the formula for the distance traveled by a point on a circular path to find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade:

distance = (revolutions x radius) / 1000

Since the point is on the edge of the fan blade, the radius is half the diameter of the fan blade, which is 10 centimeters.

distance = (0.3 revolutions x 10 centimeters) / 1000

distance = 30 centimeters

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have the expression x = (n^2 + 2√n(n + 4) + 16)/(n + 4√n + 4).

First, let's simplify the expression by combining like terms:

x = (n^2 + 2n + 16)/(n + 4)

Now, we can see that the numerator is always greater than or equal to n^2, since we have added 2n and 16 to it. Therefore, the numerator is always greater than or equal to n^2.

The denominator is always greater than or equal to n, since we have added 4 to it.

So, we can set up the following inequality:

n^2 + 2n + 16 > n^2 + 4

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

2n + 16 > 4

Solving for n, we get:

n > 12

Now, we can set up the following inequality:

x = (n^2 + 2n + 16)/(n + 4) > (12^2 + 2(12) + 16)/(12 + 4)

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. We know that the space shuttle can travel 700 m high in 40 seconds, so its vertical velocity is:

700 m / 40 s = 17.5 m/s

2. We also know that it takes 5 seconds to pass a point, so the horizontal velocity is:

5 s / 40 s = 0.125 m/s (since the horizontal velocity is 1/40th of the vertical velocity)

3. Now, we can use the formula for distance traveled to find the length of the space shuttle:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:

1. A starts the business with Rs. 40,000.
2. After 2 months, B joins with Rs. 60,000.
3. C joins them after some more time (we don't know when).
4. At the end of the year, the total profit is Rs. 375,000.
5. C gets Rs. 150,000 as his share.

Now, let's think about the profit distribution:

Profit = Rs. 375,000

A's share = (40,000 + 60,000) x 12 = Rs. 240,000 (for 2 months)
B's share = Rs. 60,000 x 12 = Rs. 72,000 (for 2 months)
C's share = Rs. 150,000 (for however many months he joined)

Now, let's calculate C's share:

C's share = (375,000 - 240,000 - 72,000) / 12 = Rs. 150,000

Now, we can calculate the number of months C joined:

C's share = Rs. 150,000

150,000 / 12 = 12,500

12,500 / 12 = 1040

B) 8.79
C) 8.75
D) 8.71
E) 8.72
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The area of the paper is equal to the area of the two semi-circles plus the area of the remaining paper.

The area of each semi-circle is given by:

Area of semi-circle = (1/2)r^2, where r is the radius of the semi-circle.

Since the semi-circles are drawn on the opposite sides of the paper as diameters, the radius of each semi-circle is half the length of the side of the paper, which is 20 cm.

So, the area of each semi-circle is:

Area of semi-circle = (1/2)(20/2)^2 = 80 cm^2

Now, we need to find the area of the remaining paper. To do this, we need to subtract the area of the two semi-circles from the total area of the paper.

Total area of paper = 2 x Area of semi-circle + Area of remaining paper

Total area of paper = 2 x 80 cm^2 + Area of remaining paper

Total area of paper = 160 cm^2 + Area of remaining paper

Now, we can find the area of the remaining paper by subtracting the area of the two semi-circles from the total area of the paper:

Area of remaining paper = 160 cm^2 - 80 cm^2

Area of remaining paper = 80 cm^2

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 80 cm^2.",C

D) M + 3 N / 8
E) M + N / 5
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

First, we know that the athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so their running speed is:

M / 4

Since they run for 4 hours, this is their average speed.

Next, we know that the athlete rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so their biking speed is:

N / 4

Since they ride for 4 hours, this is also their average speed.

Now, we need to find the average speed for both activities combined. We can do this by adding the two speeds together:

M / 4 + N / 4

Since both activities take the same amount of time (4 hours), we can simplify this by adding the distances traveled:

M + N

Therefore, the answer is:

Answer Choices:
A) 93 men
B) 94 men
C) 95 men
D) 96 men
E) 97 men
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The work can be completed in 6 days by 1 man, so the workload per day is:

Workload per day = 1 day's work / 1 man = 6 days' work / 1 man

Workload per day = 6 days \* 24 hours / 1 man

Workload per day = 144 hours / 1 man

2. Since we want to complete the same work in half the time, we need to double the workload per day:

Workload per day = 2 \* 144 hours / 1 man

Workload per day = 288 hours / 1 man

3. Now, we need to find out how many men are required to complete the work in half the time. We can do this by dividing the workload per day by the workload per man:

Men required = workload per day / workload per man

Men required = 288 hours / man

4. Since we want to find out how many men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day, we need to half the workload per man:

Workload per man = 288 hours / 2

Workload per man = 144 hours

5. Finally, we can find out how many men are required to complete the work in 1/2 day by dividing the workload per man by the workload per day:

Men required = workload per man / workload per day

Men required = 144 hours / 288 hours

Men required = 1/2

The answer is:

B) 94 men.

Explanation:

We need 94 men to complete the same work in 1/2 day, since each man can complete 1/2 of the work in 1 day.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Total number of members in the original group:
64 boys + 40 girls = 104
2. Ratio of boys to girls: 4:3
3. Let's assume the number of boys and girls who joined the group is x and y, respectively.
4. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we can write:
x = 4y
5. We know that the total number of members in the group after the membership drive is the sum of the original members and the new members:
104 + x + y = 277 (given in the answer choices)
6. Substituting x = 4y, we get:
104 + 4y + y = 277
7. Combine like terms:
5y + y = 277
6y = 277
8. Divide both sides by 6:
y = 46
9. Now we can find the number of boys who joined:
x = 4y = 4(46) = 184

C) 12 kmph
D) 14 kmph
E) 6 kmph
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Let's say the man rows at a rate of x kmph in still water.

When he rows against the current, his rate is 2 kmph less than his rate in still water, so his rate against the current is:

x - 2 kmph

Now, we know that the man's total distance traveled, including both the distance he rows against the current and the distance he rows in still water, is equal to the distance he would have traveled if he had only rowed in still water:

Distance = x + (x - 2) = 2x - 2 km

Since the man's total distance traveled is 4 km, we can set up the equation:

2x - 2 = 4

Solving for x, we get:

2x = 6

x = 3

So, the man's rate in still water is 3 kmph, and his rate along the current is 3 - 2 = 1 kmph.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

From the problem statement, we know that the sum of the digits of the three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. We also know that subtracting 495 from the number gives us a number consisting of the same digits written in reverse order.

First, let's calculate the sum of the digits of the number:

17 = 1 + 7 + 9

So, the digits of the number are 1, 7, and 9.

Next, let's calculate the sum of the squares of the digits:

109 = 1^2 + 7^2 + 9^2

So, the squares of the digits are 1, 49, and 81.

Now, let's subtract 495 from the number:

495 - 1 = 494

We can see that the digits of the number are the same as the digits of 494, written in reverse order:

D) 59 : 91
E) 69 : 101
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the problem.

We know that alloy X is made of 6 parts zinc and 9 parts copper, so the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9.

Similarly, we know that alloy Y is made of 7 parts zinc and 11 parts copper, so the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11.

When we mix 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y, we have a total of 100 grams of the mixture (40 + 60 = 100).

Since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy X is 6:9, the number of grams of zinc in alloy X is 6 x 40 = 240 grams, and the number of grams of copper in alloy X is 9 x 40 = 360 grams.

Similarly, since the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11, the number of grams of zinc in alloy Y is 7 x 60 = 420 grams, and the number of grams of copper in alloy Y is 11 x 60 = 660 grams.

When we mix the two alloys, we have a total of 240 + 420 = 660 grams of zinc and 360 + 660 = 1020 grams of copper.

So, the ratio of zinc to copper in the mixture (alloy Z) is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze the information given:

1. Hoopsmot contributes $16,000 to the bribery pool.
2. Smolapon contributes $4,000 to the bribery pool.
3. Their total allows them to influence 30 senators.

From the given information, we can infer that:

1. Hoopsmot's contribution is 4/5 of the total bribery pool (16,000/5 = 4,000).
2. Smolapon's contribution is 1/5 of the total bribery pool (4,000/5 = 1,000).
3. The total number of senators influenced is 30.

Now, let's find out how many senators can be considered Hoopsmot's:

Hoopsmot's contribution is 4/5 of the total bribery pool, so the number of senators influenced by Hoopsmot's contribution is:

4/5 x 30 = 24

Given:

* The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000.
* The sum of the numbers is 1000.

We can start by writing the equation for the difference between the squares of two numbers:

(x^2 - y^2) = 256000

Since the sum of the numbers is 1000, we can write:

x + y = 1000

Now we have two equations and two unknowns (x and y). Can you solve for x and y?

The answer is:

B) 628 and 372.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

We know that the astronaut weighs 211 pounds on Earth, and on Venus, they would weigh 182 pounds. To find the percentage difference, we can use the following formula:

Percentage difference = (new value - old value) / old value

In this case, the new value is 182 pounds, and the old value is 211 pounds.

So, we can calculate the percentage difference as follows:

Percentage difference = (182 - 211) / 211
= (39) / 211
= 0.184

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 70%.

D) 555 meters
E) 600 meters
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is B) 1000 meters.

Let's analyze the situation:

1. Both Ram and Krishna start from A and B, respectively, at the same time.
2. They travel towards each other at constant speeds of 20 m/s and 40 m/s, respectively.
3. Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds.

We can let the distance between A and B be x meters. Since they are traveling at constant speeds, we can use the formula:

Distance = Speed x Time

For Ram, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 20 m/s x 10 s = 200 meters

For Krishna, the distance traveled is:

Distance = 40 m/s x 10 s = 400 meters

Since they meet at point C, the total distance between A and B is the sum of the distances traveled by both Ram and Krishna:

Total distance = 200 meters + 400 meters = 1000 meters

C) 240
D) 320
E) 360
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

Let's start with the information that the store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. We know that 80% of the inventory was sold, which means that 80% of 600 is 480 (600 x 0.8).

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the number of yellow golf balls sold. So, if we let x be the number of yellow golf balls sold, then the number of white golf balls sold is also x.

We know that the total number of golf balls sold is 480, so we can set up the equation:

x + x = 480

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x = 480

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 240

So, the store had 240 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

C) 13.5 metre
D) 14 metre
E) 15 metre
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given:

* The flagstaff is 17.5 meters high.
* The shadow of the flagstaff is 40.25 meters long.

We know that the ratio of the height of the flagstaff to its shadow is the same as the ratio of the height of the building to its shadow. In other words, if the height of the flagstaff is x meters, then the shadow of the flagstaff is x \* 40.25 meters long.

We are asked to find the height of the building.

So, we can set up an equation:

x \* 40.25 = 28.75 (since the shadow of the building is 28.75 meters long)

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 28.75 / 40.25

x = 12.12

So, the height of the building is approximately 12.12 meters.

The answer is:

B) 12.5 meters.

Note that the answer is not exactly 12 meters, but approximately 12.12 meters. This is because we are rounding the decimal value of 28.75 to the nearest tenth.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 3 hours
B) 5 hours
C) 6 hours
D) 4 hours
E) 7 hours
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the distance between the cars at the starting point is 0 miles.

The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph, so it covers:

55 miles/hour x time = distance

where time is the time it takes for the car to travel a distance.

We want to find out how much time it takes for the cars to be 15 miles apart, so we set up an equation:

55 miles/hour x time = 15 miles

Now, we know that the second car travels at a steady rate of 52 mph, so it covers:

52 miles/hour x time = 15 miles

We can set up an equation for the second car as well:

52 miles/hour x time = 15 miles

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (time and distance). We can solve this system of equations by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution.

We know that the first car travels at 55 mph, so we can start by solving for time in the first equation:

55 miles/hour x time = 15 miles

time = 15 miles / 55 miles/hour

time = 0.273 hours (or 16 minutes)

Now, we can substitute the value of time into the second equation:

52 miles/hour x 0.273 hours = 15 miles

13.19 miles/hour x 0.273 hours = 15 miles

13.19 miles/hour x 16 minutes = 15 miles

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is C) 6 hours.

C) 0.7
D) 0.8
E) 0.9
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that the events A and B are independent, so the probability that event B occurs is not affected by the probability of event A occurring. Therefore, we can calculate the probability of event B occurring independently of event A.

We also know that the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. This means that the probability of neither event occurring is 0.04 (1 - 0.96).

Now, we can use the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle to find the probability of event B occurring:

P(B) = P(A ∩ B) + P(B ∩ ¬A)

Since the events A and B are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.6 × 0.6 = 0.36.

P(B ∩ ¬A) = P(B) × P(¬A) = 0.6 × (1 - 0.6) = 0.6 × 0.4 = 0.24.

Therefore,

P(B) = P(B ∩ A) + P(B ∩ ¬A) = 0.36 + 0.24 = 0.60.

Answer Choices:
A) 2 : π
B) 7 : 2
C) 8 : 2
D) 6 : π
E) 8 : 3
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's dive into this problem.

The volume of a cube with side length x is x^3.

The volume of a sphere with radius x is (4/3)πx^3.

Since the sphere fits inside the cube, we know that the volume of the sphere is less than or equal to the volume of the cube.

So, we can set up an inequality:

(4/3)πx^3 ≤ x^3

Now, we can simplify the inequality by multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

4πx^3 ≤ 3x^3

Now, we can simplify further by factoring out the 3 from the left-hand side:

4πx^3 = 3(πx^3)

Since π is a constant, we can pull it out of the inequality:

4πx^3 ≤ 3πx^3

Now, we can see that the left-hand side is equal to 4 times the right-hand side, so we can divide both sides by 4:

πx^3 ≤ x^3

Now, we can simplify further by factoring out the π from the left-hand side:

πx^3 = x^3

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 8 : 2.

In this solution, we used the fact that the volume of a sphere is given by (4/3)πr^3, where r is the radius of the sphere, and the volume of a cube is given by x^3, where x is the side length of the cube. By setting up an inequality and simplifying it, we were able to find the ratio of the volumes of the cube and sphere.",D

1. We need at least two ties of the same colour.
2. There are a total of 8 red, 13 violet, 10 blue, 5 pink, and 4 green ties.
3. We can take out at most 5 ties (since there are only 5 ties of each colour).

Now, let's count the number of pairs of ties we can form with the given colours:

1. Red: 8 ties, but we can only form pairs of 2 ties since we need at least two ties of the same colour.
2. Violet: 13 ties, but we can only form pairs of 2 ties.
3. Blue: 10 ties, but we can only form pairs of 2 ties.
4. Pink: 5 ties, but we can only form pairs of 2 ties.
5. Green: 4 ties, but we can only form pairs of 2 ties.

Total number of pairs of ties we can form: 8 + 13 + 10 + 5 + 4 = 30 pairs.

Since we need at least two ties of the same colour, we must take out at least 2 ties. Therefore, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

First, we know that the merchant purchased 90 kg of oranges for Rs. 450, so the cost per kg is:

Rs. 450 / 90 kg = Rs. 5 per kg

Next, we know that the merchant sold the whole lot at the rate of Rs. 7.50 per kg, so the revenue generated is:

90 kg x Rs. 7.50 per kg = Rs. 675

Answer Choices:
A) 1 minute
B) 2 minutes
C) 3 minutes
D) 4 minutes
E) 5 minutes
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say Janice bikes for x minutes, and Jennie bikes for y minutes. Since they bike at different speeds, we can assume that x and y are not equal.

We know that Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, so she bikes 1 mile in 10 minutes. Therefore, if Janice bikes for x minutes, she will bike 1 mile in x/10 minutes.

Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, so she bikes 1 mile in 5 minutes (since 20/10 = 2, and 2 x 5 = 10). If Jennie bikes for y minutes, she will bike 1 mile in y/5 minutes.

Since they have to bike together for 1 mile, we can set up the equation:

x/10 + y/5 = 1

Now we can solve for x and y. We can start by multiplying both sides of the equation by 10 to eliminate the fractions:

10x + 5y = 10

Now we can simplify the equation:

10x + 5y = 10

x + y = 2

Now we can solve for x and y:

x = 2 - 5y
y = 2 - x

Now we can substitute the values we found for x and y into the equation we set up earlier:

(2 - 5y)/10 + (2 - x)/5 = 1

Now we can simplify and solve for y:

(2 - 5y)/10 + (2 - x)/5 = 1

y = 4 - 2x

Now we can substitute the value we found for y into the equation we set up earlier:

(2 - 5y)/10 + (2 - x)/5 = 1

(2 - 5(4 - 2x))/10 + (2 - x)/5 = 1

Now we can simplify and solve for x:

(2 - 5(4 - 2x))/10 + (2 - x)/5 = 1

C) 270
D) 2702
E) 960
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's start with the information given in the problem:

* The candidate secured 504 marks out of a maximum of M.
* If the maximum mark M is converted to 800 marks, the candidate would have secured 420 marks.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the value of M.

We know that the candidate secured 504 marks, so we can set up an equation based on that:

504 = M x (100%)

Now, we know that the candidate would have secured 420 marks if the maximum mark was 800, so we can set up another equation based on that:

420 = M x (80%)

Now, we have two equations and two unknowns (M and the conversion factor). Can you solve for M?

The answer is:

The answer is C) 270.

To explain, we can solve the system of equations as follows:

First, we can solve the first equation for M:

M = 504 / 100%

M = 504 / 100

M = 5040

Next, we can solve the second equation for M:

M = 420 / 80%

M = 420 / 0.8

M = 525

Now that we have found M, we can check that the candidate secured 504 marks out of 525 marks (80% of 650):

504 = 525 x (100%)

Given:

* One ant is 4 inches tall and casts a shadow that is 10 inches long.
* The other ant is 6 inches tall.

We need to find the length of the shadow that the taller ant casts.

Let's start by using the information that the shadow of the 4-inch tall ant is 10 inches long. We can say that the height of the shadow is equal to the height of the ant. So, the shadow of the taller ant will be longer by the amount that the height of the taller ant exceeds the height of the shorter ant.

The height of the taller ant is 6 inches - 4 inches = 2 inches more than the height of the shorter ant. Therefore, the shadow of the taller ant will be 2 inches longer than the shadow of the shorter ant.

Since the shadow of the shorter ant is 10 inches long, the shadow of the taller ant will be 10 + 2 = 12 inches long.

* The area of the walls is 15 sq m (15 x 100 = 1500 sq cm)
* The width of the paper is 50 cm
* The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260 (260/100 = 2.6)

We know that the area of the walls is 15 sq m, so the length of the walls is:

15 sq m = 15 x 100 = 1500 sq cm

Since the width of the paper is 50 cm, the number of meters of paper needed is:

1500 sq cm / 50 cm/m = 30 m

Now, we can calculate the height of the room:

Height = 30 m x 2.5 = 75 m

The answer is:

C) 4 m

Note: The other options are not correct because they do not satisfy the given constraints. For example, option A (2.6 m) is not a multiple of 2.5, and option E (4.4 m) is not the correct height given the other constraints.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

The sum of k consecutive integers is 51.

The least integer is -50.

So, we can start by adding -50 to the sequence:

-50 + (1) = -50 + 1 = -49

Now, we have a sequence of -49 and 1. The sum of these two numbers is:

-49 + 1 = 49

Since we want the sum to be 51, we need to add one more number to the sequence. Let's add 2:

-49 + 1 + 2 = 49 + 2 = 51

So, the sequence of k consecutive integers starting from -50 is:

-50, 1, 2

E) 18
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. Each student selected 2 songs, so the total number of selections is 2 x 10 = 20.
2. Each selection was made 5 times, so the total number of times the 10 songs were selected is 20 x 5 = 100.
3. Since each student selected 2 songs, there are 100 / 2 = 50 students who selected at least one song.

The answer is C) 32.

Here's the reasoning:

100 students selected 2 songs each, so the total number of selections is 2 x 100 = 200.

Since each selection was made 5 times, the total number of times the 10 songs were selected is 200 x 5 = 1000.

Since each student selected 2 songs, there are 1000 / 2 = 500 students who selected at least one song.

Finally, since each student could only select two songs, the maximum number of students who could have selected any song is 500.

1. The PM speaks before the MP.
2. The MP speaks before the MLA.

So, the order of speakers is: PM, MP, MLA.

Now, we need to arrange the speakers in this order. Since there are 10 speakers, we can arrange them in 10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × ... × 2 × 1 = 10,000,000,000 possible ways.

However, not all of these arrangements satisfy the protocol. We need to eliminate those that do not.

1. The PM speaks before the MP, so the first speaker must be the PM.
2. The MP speaks before the MLA, so the second speaker must be the MP.

So, we can eliminate all arrangements that do not start with the PM as the first speaker, and do not have the MP as the second speaker.

Therefore, the number of possible ways to hold the meeting is:

E) $ 40
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

First, we know that the original price of each article was $x, and after a 15% discount, the new price is 85% of the original price, or:

x - 15% = 85% x

x - 15% = 0.85x

Now, we know that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease. So, the total cost of the 5 articles would be:

5 x (0.85x) = 5 x 0.85x

Simplifying, we get:

5x = 4.25x

Solving for x, we get:

x = $40

So, the original price of each article was $40, and after the 15% discount, the new price is:

$40 - 15% = $34

D) 40 / 7
E) 50 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say we have 10 kg of the mixture, and it contains 30% sand and 70% clay. This means that the amount of sand in the mixture is:

30% of 10 kg = 3 kg

And the amount of clay in the mixture is:

70% of 10 kg = 7 kg

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove the excess clay and replace it with pure sand. We can do this by subtracting the amount of clay from the total mixture and adding the same amount of pure sand.

So, we need to remove:

7 kg - 3 kg = 4 kg

of clay and replace it with:

4 kg / 7 kg = 0.57 (or 57%) of pure sand

Therefore, we need to add:

0.57 x 10 kg = 5.7 kg

of pure sand to the mixture to make it contain equal quantities of clay and sand.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

The problem states that we have 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips, and we want to make the greatest number of identical bouquets possible without leaving any flowers out.

First, let's consider the minimum number of tulips we need to make a bouquet. Since we want to make identical bouquets, we need to have the same number of white and red tulips in each bouquet.

The minimum number of tulips we need is therefore:

28 (white) + 98 (red) = 126

Now, we can start making bouquets. Since we have 126 tulips, we can make:

126 / 2 = 63 bouquets with 28 white tulips and 98 red tulips each

But wait, we can also make bouquets with 27 white tulips and 99 red tulips, since we have 28 - 1 = 27 white tulips left over, and 98 - 1 = 99 red tulips left over.

So, we can make:

126 / 3 = 42 bouquets with 27 white tulips and 99 red tulips each

Adding up all the bouquets we can make, we get:

63 + 42 = 105 bouquets

E) 1023.65
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 35.62.

Let's analyze the given information:

1. Roberts' property worth is $1023.65.
2. The recorded property worth is a greatest positive even integer less than or equal to $1023.65 and is divisible by 100.

Since the recorded property worth must be an even integer, we can start by looking for even integers between $1023.65 and $1024 (since $1024 is the next even integer after $1023.65).

The closest even integer to $1023.65 that is divisible by 100 is $1024. This means that Roberts' recorded property worth is $1024.

Now, we can find the difference between the actual and recorded property worth:

Actual property worth = $1023.65
Recorded property worth = $1024

Difference = $1024 - $1023.65 = $0.35

Therefore, the difference between the actual and recorded property worth is $35.62.",A

A) 9 Trousers
B) 8 Trousers
C) 10 Trousers
D) 7 Trousers
E) 11 Trousers
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's first calculate the total amount the man spends on shirts:

30 x (number of shirts) = 810 - 70 x (number of trouser)

Since the man spends 810 on both trouser and shirts, we can set up the equation:

30x + 70y = 810

where x is the number of shirts and y is the number of trouser.

Now, we can solve for x and y:

30x + 70y = 810

70y = 810 - 30x

y = 810 - 30x / 70

Now, we can find the maximum number of trouser the man can purchase:

70y = 810 - 30x

y = 810 - 30x / 70

To find the maximum number of trouser, we need to find the value of x that maximizes the expression 810 - 30x / 70.

Taking the derivative of 810 - 30x / 70 with respect to x and setting it equal to 0, we get:

0 = 30 - 70y / 70

y = 30 / 70

y = 1

So, the man can purchase 11 trouser.

C) 126 km
D) 84 km
E) 48 km
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. Allen starts from X and goes to Y, so he covers a distance of XY.
2. Bob starts from Y and goes towards X, so he covers a distance of YX.
3. When Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X, so he covers a distance of YX.
4. When Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y, so he covers a distance of XY.

Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we can say that Bob's total distance traveled is 48 km more than Allen's total distance traveled. Therefore, Bob's total distance traveled is:

Bob's distance = Allen's distance + 48 km

We know that Allen's distance is XY, so:

Bob's distance = XY + 48 km

Now, we can find the distance between X and Y by solving for XY:

XY + 48 km = Bob's distance

So, we know that the customer has the option to purchase new tires for $180 per tire, or to have their current tires repaired for $40 per tire, which will make them last for one additional year.

Let's say the customer has two tires, so the total cost of new tires would be $180 x 2 = $360.

The total cost of repairing the current tires would be $40 x 2 = $80.

Now, we need to find the average cost per year of the new tires. To do this, we need to divide the total cost by the number of years the tires will last.

For the new tires, the number of years is 4, so the average cost per year is:

$360 / 4 = $90 per year

For the repaired tires, the number of years is 5, so the average cost per year is:

$80 / 5 = $16 per year

Now, we need to find the percentage increase in cost between the two options. To do this, we can divide the difference in cost by the smaller cost and multiply by 100.

The difference in cost between the two options is:

$90 - $16 = $74

$74 / $16 = 4.67 x 100 = 467%

So, the answer is:

The answer is D) 16.7%

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have a rope that is 20 meters long and we need to find the length of the longer piece of rope. We know that one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the other, so let's call the length of the longer piece ""x"" meters.

We also know that the total length of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters, so the length of the shorter piece is x - 3 meters.

We can set up an equation based on these two pieces of information:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the equation:

2x - 3 = 20

Solving for x:

2x = 23

x = 11.5

So, the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters long.

The answer is:

C) 11.9

C) $ 216
D) $ 202
E) $ 200
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, Jerry purchased a 1-year $5,000 bond that paid an annual interest rate of 12% compounded every six months. This means that the interest rate is 6% per six months, or half of the annual rate.

Since the bond has a face value of $5,000, the interest accrued at maturity can be calculated as follows:

Interest = Principal x Rate x Time

In this case, the principal is $5,000, the rate is 6% (half of the annual rate), and the time is 1 year (or 2 six-month periods).

So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:

Interest = $5,000 x 6% x 2

Interest = $5,000 x 0.06 x 2

Interest = $5,000 x 0.12 x 2

Interest = $1,200

Therefore, the answer is C) $1,200.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 3400
B) 1700
C) 3440
D) Can not be determined
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 340 meters.

The width of the plot is half of the perimeter, so the width is 340 / 2 = 170 meters.

The area of the plot is found by multiplying the width by the length, which we don't know yet. Let's call the length x meters.

The area of the plot is:

Area = width x length
= 170 x x

Since we want to garden the entire boundary, we need to add the area of the boundary to the area of the plot. The boundary is a rectangle with a perimeter of 340 meters, so the length of the boundary is also 170 meters.

The area of the boundary is:

Area of boundary = length x width
= 170 x 170
= 30,600 square meters

Now, we add the area of the boundary to the area of the plot:

Total area = Area of plot + Area of boundary
= 170 x x + 30,600

We want the total area to be 10 per square meter, so we set up the equation:

10 = 170 x x + 30,600

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 10 / 170
= 10 / 3
= 3

So, the length of the plot is 3 meters.

The area of the plot is:

Area = 170 x 3
= 510 square meters

The cost of gardening the 1-meter wide boundary around the plot at a rate of 10 per square meter is:

Cost = 10 x 510
= 5,100

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* 34% of Ace Book Company's sales revenue came from the sale of novels.
* The remaining revenue (100% - 34%) was from the sale of biographies.
* The company's revenue from the sale of biographies was 1/3 of the remaining revenue.

We can start by finding the total revenue of Ace Book Company:

Total revenue = 34% of revenue (novels) + 100% - 34% of revenue (biographies)

Substituting the values, we get:

Total revenue = 0.34 x revenue (novels) + 100% - 0.34 x revenue (biographies)

Simplifying, we get:

Total revenue = 0.34 x revenue (novels) + 66% of revenue (biographies)

Now, we can find the revenue from biographies:

Revenue from biographies = Total revenue x 66%

Substituting the value of Total revenue, we get:

Revenue from biographies = 0.66 x Total revenue

Now, we can find the ratio of revenue from novels to revenue from biographies:

Ratio = Revenue from novels / Revenue from biographies

Substituting the values, we get:

Ratio = 0.34 x revenue (novels) / 0.66 x Total revenue

Simplifying, we get:

Ratio = 0.34 x revenue (novels) / 0.66 x Total revenue

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. A crate consists of p pallets.
2. Each pallet holds 1250 phones.
3. The manufacturer ships 4 crates.

Now, let's think about how many phones are in each crate:

1 crate = p pallets x 1250 phones/pallet = p x 1250 phones

Since the manufacturer ships 4 crates, we can multiply the number of phones in each crate by 4 to find the total number of phones shipped:

4 crates = 4 x p x 1250 phones = 4p x 1250 phones

Now, we can solve for p, the number of pallets in each crate:

p = 4p x 1250 phones / 1250 phones = 4

C) 20 seconds
D) 33 seconds
E) 55 seconds
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

1. The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which means it spends 3 seconds accelerating from its initial speed to its final speed while entering the tunnel.
2. The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour, so we can calculate its speed as it enters the tunnel:

120 miles/hour x 1 mile/hour = 120 seconds/mile

Since the train enters the tunnel at a speed of 120 miles per hour, it will travel the length of the tunnel (1 mile) in:

120 seconds/mile x 1 mile = 120 seconds

So, the train spends 120 seconds entering the tunnel.

3. Now, we need to find out how long it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel. Since the train enters the tunnel at a speed of 120 miles per hour and travels for 120 seconds, it will cover a distance of:

120 seconds x 120 miles/hour = 14,400 feet

Since the train travels at a constant speed of 120 miles per hour throughout the tunnel, it will take:

14,400 feet / 120 miles/hour = 120 seconds

to pass completely through the tunnel.

The answer is:

B) 39 seconds

The train takes 39 seconds to enter the tunnel and 120 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel, for a total time of 159 seconds.",D

What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount ?
Answer Choices:
A) 247.67
B) 237.67
C) 227.67
D) 215.67
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the invoice terms:

* 4/30 means the payment is due 30 days after the invoice date.
* n/100 means the discount is 100 - n% of the invoice amount.

So, if the merchant pays within 30 days, they will receive a discount of 100 - n% of the invoice amount.

To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to find the highest discount rate (100 - n%) that the merchant can afford to give up.

Let's assume the merchant wants to borrow $20,000 for one year. The simple interest rate is the ratio of the interest to the principal, so we can set up an equation:

Interest = Principal x Rate

Since the merchant wants to borrow $20,000 for one year, the interest rate should be annualized. We can divide the interest by the number of years to get the simple interest rate:

Interest ÷ Years = Principal x Rate

In this case, the years are 1 year, so we can set up the equation:

$20,000 ÷ 1 = Principal x Rate

$20,000 = Principal x Rate

Now we can solve for the principal (P) and the interest rate (R):

P x R = $20,000

R = $20,000 ÷ P

We know that the merchant wants to pay 4/30, so the payment is due 30 days after the invoice date. We can assume that the invoice date is the beginning of the year (January 1st), so the payment is due on February 28th (30 days later).

The merchant wants to borrow $20,000 for one year, so the payment will be due on February 28th of the following year.

Now we can set up the equation:

P x R = $20,000

P = $20,000 ÷ R

We can solve for R by dividing both sides of the equation by P:

C) Rs . 5.6
D) Rs . 8
E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

1. First, we know that the company produces 7200 pens, and each pen is priced at Rs. 10.
2. We also know that on average, 10% of the produced pens are defective, so we need to subtract the defective pens from the total number of pens produced.
3. Since the company promises to deliver 7200 pens, and 10% of 7200 is 720 (defective pens), we need to subtract 720 from the total number of pens produced.
4. So, the total number of pens produced and sold is 7200 - 720 = 6480 pens.
5. We know that the company earns a profit of 25% on all the manufactured pens. To find the profit, we need to multiply the total number of pens produced and sold by the profit percentage.
6. Profit = 25% x 6480 = 1620
7. Now, we need to find the manufactured cost of each pen. To do this, we can use the fact that the profit is 1620, and the total number of pens produced and sold is 6480.
8. Manufactured cost per pen = 1620 / 6480 = 0.25 x 10 = Rs. 2.5
9. Therefore, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 2.5.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

So, we have two expressions, L(x,y) and R(x,y), and we want to determine if it's possible to find two positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y).

First, let's define these expressions:

L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y]

R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]

Now, let's think about what these expressions represent. L(x,y) is the sum of the greatest integer less than or equal to x, the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and the greatest integer less than or equal to x+y. R(x,y) is the sum of the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x, the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y, and the greatest integer less than or equal to 2(x+y).

Now, let's consider the possible values of L(x,y) and R(x,y) for positive real numbers x and y.

L(x,y) can take values such as:

* [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [x] + [y] + (x+y) = [x+y+1]
* [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [x] + [y] + (x+y) = [x+y+2]
* [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [x] + [y] + (x+y) = [x+y+3]

and so on.

R(x,y) can take values such as:

* [2x] + [2y] = [2x] + [2(y+1)] = [2x+2y+2]
* [2x] + [2y] = [2x] + [2(x+y)] = [2x+2(x+y)] = [2x+2y+2x+2y+2] = [2x+2y+4]

E) none
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: Let's analyze the given information:

1. First bell rings after 36 seconds.
2. Second bell rings after 40 seconds.
3. Third bell rings after 48 seconds.

We can observe that the difference between the ringing times of consecutive bells is:

36 - 40 = 4 seconds (difference between first and second bell)
40 - 48 = 8 seconds (difference between second and third bell)

Now, we can find the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 8, which is 16. So, the bells will ring together again after 16 times the shortest ringing time, which is 36 seconds:

16 x 36 = 576 seconds

Therefore, the bells will ring together again after 576 seconds, which is equivalent to 9.6 minutes (576 / 60).

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

Given:

* The electric pole is 14 meters high.
* The shadow of the electric pole is 10 meters long.

We know that the height of the tree is less than the height of the electric pole, so we can set up an equation based on the ratio of the heights and the shadows:

Tree height : Electric pole height = Shadow of tree : Shadow of electric pole

We know that the shadow of the tree is 15 meters long, and the shadow of the electric pole is 10 meters long. So we can set up the equation:

15 : 10 = Tree height : Electric pole height

Now, we can solve for the tree height. We know that the electric pole height is 14 meters, so we can substitute that value in the equation:

15 : 10 = 14 : ?

We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 10:

15 : 10 = 14 : ?

150 : 100 = 140 : ?

Now, we can see that the answer is 22, so the height of the tree is 22 meters.

* The triangle has vertices at (a, 0), (b, 0), and (x, y).
* a > x > b > 0 > y.

We can start by finding the height of the triangle, which is the distance from the base (x) to the vertex (y). Since a > x > b, the height is at least b and less than x. Therefore, the height is (x - b).

Now, we can find the area of the triangle using the formula:

Area = (base × height) / 2

In this case, the base is x, and the height is (x - b). So, the area is:

Area = (x × (x - b)) / 2

C) 120 kmph
D) 70 kmph
E) 80 kmph
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze this problem step by step.

Let's say the distance the car travels is x kilometers.

We know that the car travels at a speed of 60 km/hr, so the time it takes to cover the distance is:

time = distance / speed

time = x / 60

We also know that the car travels the same distance in 10 hours, so we can set up an equation:

x / 60 = 10

Now, we can solve for x:

x = 600

So, the distance the car travels is 600 kilometers.

Now, we can find out the speed the car gains by comparing the time it takes to cover the distance:

time for 10 hours = time for 20 hours / 2

time for 10 hours = 20 / 2 = 10

So, the car gains a speed of:

speed gain = (time for 20 hours - time for 10 hours) / time for 10 hours

speed gain = (20 - 10) / 10

speed gain = 10 / 10

speed gain = 1

The answer is:

The car gains a speed of 1 km/hr.",C

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

Let's consider the probability that Alan guesses correctly:

Probability of Alan guessing correctly = 1/5

Now, let's consider the probability that Roger answers correctly by looking at the paper of the student in front of him:

Probability of Roger answering correctly = 2/3

Now, let's consider the probability that Peter answers correctly by performing the calculations and marking the answer:

Probability of Peter answering correctly = 5/6

Now, we need to find the probability that the question is answered correctly, but not via cheating. This means we need to find the probability that none of the three friends cheated.

So, we can use the following formula to find the probability:

Probability of none of the three friends cheating = (1 - Probability of Alan cheating) x (1 - Probability of Roger cheating) x (1 - Probability of Peter cheating)

Substituting the probabilities, we get:

Probability of none of the three friends cheating = (1 - 1/5) x (1 - 2/3) x (1 - 5/6)

Simplifying, we get:

Probability of none of the three friends cheating = (4/5) x (3/4) x (6/7)

Simplifying further, we get:

Probability of none of the three friends cheating = 12/45

So, the answer is:

C) 6 %
D) 8 %
E) 4 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The difference between simple interest and compound interest at the same rate for Rs. 5000 for 2 years is Rs. 72.

We know that simple interest is calculated as the principal amount x rate x time, so for 2 years, the simple interest would be:

SI = 5000 x 2 x rate

where rate is the interest rate as a decimal.

Now, we know that the compound interest is calculated as the principal amount x (1 + rate/100)^2, so for 2 years, the compound interest would be:

CI = 5000 x (1 + rate/100)^2

Since the difference between the simple interest and compound interest is Rs. 72, we can set up the equation:

SI - CI = 72

Now, we can substitute the values we know:

5000 x 2 x rate - 5000 x (1 + rate/100)^2 = 72

Simplifying and solving for rate, we get:

rate = 8%

Therefore, the answer is D) 8%.

B) 70
C) 75
D) 100
E) 125
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given:

* The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.
* 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.

From the first point, we know that the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So, if x is the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm, then the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5x.

From the second point, we know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the number of files not infected by a virus is 50% of 250, which is 125.

Now, we can set up an equation based on the information:

2.5x + 125 = 250

Solving for x, we get:

2.5x = 125

x = 50

So, there are 50 files infected by both a virus and a worm.

Now, we can find the number of files not infected by a worm by subtracting the number of files infected by a worm from the total number of files:

125 - 2.5(50) = 125 - 125 = 0

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is 0.

So, none of Sam's files were not infected by a worm.",C

E) None of these
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

Let's say Mohan's share is x. So, Sohan's share is 5100 - x.

We know that if they invest their shares at a compound interest rate of 4% per annum, they will receive equal amounts when they turn 26.

So, we can set up the equation:

x + (5100 - x) = 5100 x 1.04^26

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 5100 = 5100 x 1.04^26

Solving for x:

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

2x = 5100 x 1.04^26 - 5100

The answer is C) 2600.

D) w / ( 3 xy)
E) 3 y / ( wx)
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

We know that the liquid passes through the drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. We can start by converting the rate from gallons per second to gallons per minute:

1 minute = 60 seconds

So, the rate in gallons per minute is:

w/25 gallons/second x 60 seconds/minute = w/25 x 60 = 2w/5 gallons/minute

Now, we know that y gallons will pass through the drain, so we can set up the equation:

2w/5 gallons/minute x y minutes = y gallons

To solve for y, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2w/5:

y minutes = (2w/5) x y = 2xy

Now we can solve for y:

y = 2xy / 2w/5

The answer is:

The answer is A) y / (1200 xy)

Explanation:
We divided both sides of the equation by 2w/5 to solve for y, and the result is y / (1200 xy), which is the correct answer.",C

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver , what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum ?
Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by analyzing the given information:

1. The coin is made of an alloy of aluminum and silver, and its weight is 30 grams.
2. The diameter of the coin is 15 mm, and it is 2 mm thick.
3. The volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy.

Now, let's think about how we can use this information to find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum. Since the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver in the alloy, we can assume that the weight of the aluminum in the coin is equal to the weight of the silver in the coin.

We know that the weight of the coin is 30 grams, and the weight of one gram of silver is twice the weight of one gram of aluminum. Therefore, the weight of the silver in the coin is 2 x 30 grams = 60 grams.

So, the weight of the aluminum in the coin is also 60 grams, since the weight of the aluminum is equal to the weight of the silver.

Now, we need to find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with a diameter of 1 x 30 mm. Since the thickness of the coin is 2 mm, the volume of the coin is:

Volume = π x (1 x 30 mm)^2 x 2 mm = 3.46 cubic centimeters (cm^3)

We know that the weight of one gram of aluminum is 2.70 grams, so the weight of 3.46 cm^3 of aluminum is:

Weight = 3.46 cm^3 x 2.70 grams/cm^3 = 9.25 grams

Therefore, the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum with a diameter of 1 x 30 mm is 9.25 grams.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Given:

* 2/3 of a number is equal to 40 + 1/3 of the number.
* If 10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number, the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.

Let's start by finding 2/3 of a number. We know that 2/3 of 100 is equal to 66, so let's try with 100:

2/3 of 100 = 66

Now, let's subtract 10 from 66:

66 - 10 = 56

Is 56 equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number? No, it's not.

So, let's try with a different number. How about 160?

2/3 of 160 = 100

Subtracting 10 from 100 gives us:

100 - 10 = 90

Is 90 equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number? No, it's not.

Let's try with another number. How about 220?

2/3 of 220 = 140

Subtracting 10 from 140 gives us:

Answer Choices:
A) 9

C) 3
D) 8
E) 12
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  A: The quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 can be factored as (x - 3)(x - 2) = 0. Therefore, we need to find the largest integer value of k for which both (x - 3) and (x - 2) are simultaneously zero.

The equation (x - 3) = 0 has two solutions: x = 3 and x = -3.

The equation (x - 2) = 0 has two solutions: x = 2 and x = -2.

Since we need two real and distinct roots, we can choose the roots of (x - 3) and (x - 2) such that they are distinct and real. Therefore, we can choose k = 3 or k = 2.

For k = 3, the equation becomes x^2 - 5x + 3 = 0, which has distinct real roots at x = 2 and x = -1.

For k = 2, the equation becomes x^2 - 5x + 2 = 0, which has distinct real roots at x = 1 and x = -1.

Therefore, the largest integral value of k for which the quadratic equation x^2 - 5x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots is k = 2.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 30%.

Let's break down the problem:

1. At 8:00 am, the dog's bowl is filled with dog food.
2. At 9:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.
3. At 10:00 am, the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.
4. At noon (12:00 pm), the dog eats 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.

Since the dog eats exactly once an hour, and there are 4 hours between 8:00 am and noon, the dog eats a total of 4/3 = 1 1/3 times.

So, at noon, there is 1 - 1 1/3 = 1/3 of the original food left in the bowl.

Since the dog ate 1/3 of the original food at each feeding session, the percentage of the original food that was left in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is 1/3 of the original food, which is 30%.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. 60% of the people who took the survey were women.
2. Of the men who were surveyed, 75% preferred red cars over green cars.

We can start by finding out how many women took the survey. Since 60% of the survey takers were women, we can multiply the total number of survey takers by 0.6 to find the number of women:

Total number of survey takers x 0.6 = Number of women

Now, let's find out how many men took the survey. Since 40% of the survey takers were not women, we can subtract the number of women from the total number of survey takers to find the number of men:

Total number of survey takers - Number of women = Number of men

Now, we know that 75% of the men preferred red cars over green cars. This means that 75% of the number of men took the survey preferred red cars.

Number of men x 0.75 = Number of men who preferred red cars

We also know that 10 men preferred green cars over red cars. This means that 10 men did not prefer red cars.

Number of men - Number of men who preferred red cars = Number of men who preferred green cars

Now, we can substitute the values we have found into the equation we set up earlier:

Total number of survey takers x 0.6 = Number of women

Total number of survey takers - Number of women = Number of men

Number of men x 0.75 = Number of men who preferred red cars

Number of men - Number of men who preferred red cars = Number of men who preferred green cars

Solving this system of equations, we get:

Total number of survey takers = 120
Number of women = 72
Number of men = 48
Number of men who preferred red cars = 36
Number of men who preferred green cars = 12

So, the answer is:

C) 1.25
D) 1.5
E) 2
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

So, we know that one gallon of soft drink is made of 40% orange juice and 60% water. This means that 40% of one gallon is orange juice, and 60% is water.

If we want to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to add more orange juice to the mixture. To find out how much more, we can set up a proportion:

Let x be the number of gallons of orange juice we need to add.

We know that 40% of one gallon is 40/100 = 0.4 of a gallon, so the amount of orange juice in one gallon is 0.4 gallons.

We also know that we want the orange juice to be 60% of the soft drink, so we need to add enough orange juice to make up 60% of the total volume of the soft drink.

So, we can set up the proportion:

0.4 gallons (current orange juice) + x gallons (additional orange juice) = 0.6 gallons (desired orange juice percentage)

Simplifying the proportion, we get:

0.4 + x = 0.6

Solving for x, we get:

x = 0.6 - 0.4

x = 0.2

So, we need to add 0.2 gallons of orange juice to the mixture to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink.

The answer is C) 1.25 gallons of orange juice.",A

Answer Choices:

B) 11
C) 12
D) 13
E) 14
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say the 3-digit number is N = a hundreds digit + b tens digit + c ones digit.

When we divide 2272 by N, we have:

2272 = a*100 + b*10 + c

Since the remainder is the same as when we divide 875 by N, we know that:

875 = a*100 + b*10 + c

Now, we can equate these two equations:

2272 = a*100 + b*10 + c
875 = a*100 + b*10 + c

Subtracting the first equation from the second gives us:

2272 - 875 = a*100 + b*10 + c - 875

Simplifying, we get:

1400 = a*100 + b*10 + c

Now, we can see that the sum of the digits of N is:

a + b + c = 14

So, the answer is:

The answer is C) 12.

Since the sum of the digits of N is 12, we know that N must be a 3-digit number with digits that add up to 12. The only possible values for N are 120, 121, 122, 123, and 124. However, 124 is not possible since it would result in a remainder of 0 when divided by 2272 and 875, which is not the same remainder. Therefore, the only possible answer is C) 12.",A

C) 68 %
D) 72 %
E) 75 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let's say there are x passing students and y failing students in the class. We know that the passing students had an average of 83, so the total score of the passing students is 83x.

We also know that the failing students had an average of 55, so the total score of the failing students is 55y.

The overall class average is 76, so we can set up the equation:

83x + 55y = 76

Now, we know that the total number of students in the class is x + y. So, we can substitute x + y for the total score:

83x + 55y = (x + y)76

Simplifying the equation:

83x + 55y = 76x + 55y

Now, we can solve for x and y:

83x + 55y - 76x - 55y = 0

Simplifying further:

16x + 55y = 0

Now, we can solve for x and y:

x = 44
y = 22

So, there are 44 passing students and 22 failing students in the class.

Now, we can find the percentage of passing students:

Percentage of passing students = (44/x + y) x 100
= (44/44 + 22) x 100
= 100%

Therefore, the answer is A) 44%.",E

C) $ 90

E) $ 104
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. The average wage for the fortnight is $90 per day.
2. The average wage for the first 7 days was $87 per day.
3. The average wage for the last 7 days was $92 per day.

We know that the average wage for the first 7 days is less than the average wage for the last 7 days, since the average wage for the last 7 days is higher than $87.

Let's call the wage for the 8th day x.

We can set up two equations:

1. Sum of wages for the first 7 days = 7 x $87 = $606
2. Sum of wages for the last 7 days = 7 x $92 = $654

Since the total wages for the fortnight is $90 per day x 15 days = $1350, we can set up the following equation:

$606 + $654 = $1350

Solving the above equation, we get:

$606 = $654 - $48

Now, we can find the wage for the 8th day:

$606 = $654 - $48

x = $654 - $48

x = $606

The answer is:

B) $92

The worker's wage on the 8th day is $92.",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. We know that the two numbers are in the ratio 3:5, so we can write:

Let's say the smaller number is x and the larger number is 3x/5.

2. When we subtract 9 from each number, we get:

x - 9 = 3x/5 - 9

3. Simplifying the ratio, we get:

x - 9 = 3x/5 - 9

x - 9 = 3(x/5) - 9

x - 9 = 3x/5 - 9

4. Now, we can see that the ratio of the new numbers is 12:23, so we can set up a proportion:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

Let Ajay's present age be x.

We know that 6 years are subtracted from Ajay's present age, so Ajay's age after 6 years would be:

x - 6

The remainder when x - 6 is divided by 18 is the present age of Rahul. Since Rahul is 2 years younger than Denis, we know that Rahul's age is:

Rahul's age = Denis's age - 2

We are also given that Denis's age is 5 years. So, Rahul's age is:

Rahul's age = 5 - 2 = 3

Now, we can find Ajay's present age by substituting Rahul's age into the equation:

x - 6 = 3

Solving for x, we get:

x = 3 + 6

x = 9

Please help me to solve this problem .]  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the solution:

Let's say the cost of the ball is x. Then the cost of the bat is $1.00 more than the ball, so the cost of the bat is x + $1.00.

We know that the total cost of the bat and ball together is $1.10, so we can set up the equation:

x + (x + $1.00) = $1.10

Simplifying the equation:

2x + $1.00 = $1.10

Subtracting $1.00 from both sides:

2x = $0.10

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = $0.05

So, the ball costs $0.05.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

The average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat is 53 kg (the weight of the crew member who is being replaced).

When the crew member who weighs 53 kg is replaced by a new man, the average weight of the 10 oarsmen in the boat increases by 1.8 kg.

So, the weight of the new man is 53 kg + 1.8 kg = 54.8 kg.

The answer is C) 43.

Here's the calculation:

10 x 53 kg = 530 kg (total weight of the original crew)

10 x 54.8 kg = 548 kg (total weight of the new crew with the new man)

548 kg - 530 kg = 18 kg (increase in weight due to replacing the 53 kg crew member)

Answer Choices:
A) 11
B) 10
C) 9
D) 8
E) 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

There are a few key things to note about this problem:

1. The first ball cannot be the ball with number 3 marked on it, since it is not allowed to be selected.
2. The second ball can be any of the balls, including the one with number 3 marked on it.

With these constraints in mind, let's count the number of ways to select two balls from the box:

1. The first ball can be any of the n balls, so there are n choices for the first ball.
2. The second ball cannot be the ball with number 3 marked on it, so there are n-1 choices for the second ball.

Since the ball with number 3 marked on it cannot be selected, there are a total of n(n-1) ways to select two balls from the box.

Now, we are given that there are 45 different ways to select two balls from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected. This means that we need to find the value of n such that n(n-1) = 45.

Solving for n, we get:

n(n-1) = 45
n^2 - n - 45 = 0

Factoring this equation, we get:

(n-1)(n+45) = 0

Since n is a positive integer, we know that n-1 must be equal to 0 or n+45 must be equal to 0.

n-1 = 0 --> n = 10 (since 10 x 9 = 90, which is not equal to 45)

n+45 = 0 --> n = -45 (since -45 x -44 = 1980, which is not equal to 45)

Therefore, the answer is:

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given options:

I. Q is the square of a prime number:

If Q is the square of a prime number, then it can be written as $Q = p^2$, where $p$ is a prime number. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that $p^2$ must have at least 5 factors. However, the only factors of $p^2$ are $1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4$, so it is not possible for $Q$ to be the square of a prime number.

II. Q is the fourth power of a prime number:

If Q is the fourth power of a prime number, then it can be written as $Q = p^4$, where $p$ is a prime number. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that $p^4$ must have at least 5 factors. However, the only factors of $p^4$ are $1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4$, so it is not possible for $Q$ to be the fourth power of a prime number.

III. Q is the product of two prime numbers:

If Q is the product of two prime numbers, then it can be written as $Q = ab$, where $a$ and $b$ are prime numbers. Since $Q$ has 5 factors, we know that both $a$ and $b$ must have at least 5 factors. However, this is not possible, as the only factors of a prime number are $1$ and the prime number itself.

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the costs:

Without a membership:

* Renting 1 DVD costs $4.00

With a membership:

* Renting 1 DVD costs $2.00

So, the difference in cost between renting 1 DVD with and without a membership is:

$4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00

To make it worth it to purchase a membership, we need to calculate how many DVDs we need to rent to cover the cost of the membership.

The cost of a membership is $7.00 per month, so we need to rent:

$7.00 / $2.00 per DVD = 3.5 DVDs per month

Since we can't rent a fraction of a DVD, we need to round up to the nearest whole number:

3.5 DVDs ≈ 4 DVDs

Therefore, the minimum amount of DVDs you would need to rent to make it worth it to purchase a membership is 4 DVDs.

E) 100 AB / 27
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem step by step.

We know that 27 bottles of soda cost A cents. We can start by converting the cost from cents to dollars:

27 bottles x A cents = 27 x A dollars

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can divide both sides of the equation by 100 to get:

27 bottles x A dollars = 2700 / 100

Now we can see that the cost of 27 bottles of soda is $27.

So, to find the cost of B bottles, we can simply multiply the cost of 27 bottles by the number of bottles:

B bottles x $27 = B x 2700 / 100

Simplifying, we get:

B x $27 = B x 2700 / 100

B x $27 = 2700 / 100

B x $27 = 27

Therefore, the answer is:

The answer is B x $27 = $27.

Answer Choices:
A) 8
B) 28
C) 46
D) 66
E) 70
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We have 11 candy bars in total, and we want to select 3 of them.
2. We know that 3 candy bars cost $50 each, so the total cost of these 3 candy bars is $50 x 3 = $150.
3. We also know that 4 candy bars cost $1 each, so the total cost of these 4 candy bars is $1 x 4 = $4.
4. Therefore, the total cost of all 11 candy bars is $150 + $4 = $154.

Now, we need to find out how many ways we can select 3 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4.

Let's consider the following:

* If we select all 3 candy bars that cost $50 each, the total cost is $50 x 3 = $150, which is more than $4.
* If we select 2 candy bars that cost $50 each and 1 candy bar that costs $1, the total cost is $50 x 2 + $1 = $101, which is more than $4.
* If we select 1 candy bar that costs $50 and 2 candy bars that cost $1 each, the total cost is $50 + $1 + $1 = $62, which is more than $4.

So, there are 3 ways to select 3 candy bars so that the total cost is more than $4:

1. Select all 3 candy bars that cost $50 each.
2. Select 2 candy bars that cost $50 each and 1 candy bar that costs $1.
3. Select 1 candy bar that costs $50 and 2 candy bars that cost $1 each.

There are 4 men and 4 women in the team, so there are a total of 8 individuals.

Since each group of presenters must include at least one man and at least one woman, we can start by selecting one man and one woman to be part of the first group of presenters.

There are 4 men and 4 women to choose from, so we have a total of 4 x 4 = 16 possible combinations for the first group of presenters.

For the second group of presenters, we must choose one man and one woman from the remaining individuals. There are 3 men and 3 women left, so there are 3 x 3 = 9 possible combinations for the second group of presenters.

In total, there are 16 x 9 = 144 possible combinations of presenters.

C) 4 / 7
D) 2 / 5
E) 2 / 7
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

To be relatively prime to 1,000, a number must not have any common positive factors with 1,000 other than 1. In other words, we need to find the probability that a number chosen from S does not have any common factors with 1,000.

First, let's list the common factors of 1,000:

1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000

Now, let's count how many numbers in S have each of these common factors:

1: 100 numbers (all the even numbers from 2 to 1000)
2: 50 numbers (all the even numbers from 2 to 1000 except for 2)
4: 25 numbers (all the even numbers from 4 to 1000)
5: 20 numbers (all the odd numbers from 5 to 1000)
10: 10 numbers (all the numbers from 10 to 1000)
20: 5 numbers (all the numbers from 20 to 1000)
25: 4 numbers (all the numbers from 25 to 1000)
50: 2 numbers (only 500 and 1000)
100: 1 number (only 1000)
200: 1 number (only 200)
500: 1 number (only 500)
1000: 1 number (only 1000)

Now, let's calculate the probability that a number chosen from S does not have any common factors with 1,000:

Probability = (1 - (number of common factors)) / (total number of numbers in S)

We can calculate the number of common factors as follows:

Number of common factors = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 20 + 25 + 50 + 1",D

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this problem together.

We know that Charles received $54,080 at the end of his one-year investment, including interest and principal. We also know that the investment paid an annual interest of 8% compounded semi-annually.

First, let's calculate the interest earned on the investment. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, we can calculate the interest for each six-month period separately.

For the first six months, the interest is:

8% of $45,000 (principal) = $3,600

For the second six months, the interest is:

8% of $48,000 (principal + interest from first six months) = $3,840

Total interest earned = $3,600 + $3,840 = $7,440

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money that Charles originally invested. We know that the total amount he received at the end of the year is $54,080, which includes the principal and the interest. So, we can set up the equation:

$45,000 (principal) + $7,440 (interest) = $54,080

Solving for the principal, we get:

$45,000 + $7,440 = $54,080

The answer is:

C) $54,000

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested was $54,000.",B

Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's analyze the given information:

1. Joe's age, his sister's age, and their father's age sum up to 100.
2. When Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice as old as she is now.
3. When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was as old as her father.

Let's assume Joe's age is x. Then, his sister's age is 2x, and their father's age is 3x.

1. The sum of their ages is 100:

x + 2x + 3x = 100

Simplify:

3x + 2x = 100

5x = 100

x = 20

So, Joe is 20 years old.

2. When Joe is 20, his sister will be twice as old as she is now:

20 + 2(20) = 20 + 40 = 60

So, his sister will be 60 years old.

3. When Joe is 20, his father will be twice as old as he was when his sister was 60:

3(20) = 60

So, his father will be 60 - 20 = 40 years old.

If five registered voters are chosen at random , what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election ?
Answer Choices:
A) 26.2 %
B) 32.8 %
C) 43.7 %
D) 59.0 %
E) 65.6 %
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work through this together.

We know that there is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election. This means that the probability of a voter not voting is 10% (1 - 0.9 = 0.1).

Now, we need to find the probability that exactly four out of five voters voted in the last election. We can do this by using the binomial distribution, which models the probability of a certain number of successes (votes) in a fixed number of trials (the number of voters we are sampling).

Let's define the probability of a voter voting as p = 0.9 (since the probability of a voter not voting is 0.1). Let's also define the number of voters we are sampling as n = 5.

The probability of exactly four voters voting can be calculated as follows:

P(exactly 4 voters vote) = (5 choose 4) \* p^4 \* (1 - p)^1

= (5 choose 4) \* (0.9)^4 \* (0.1)

= 10 \* 24 \* 0.9^4 \* 0.1

= 240 \* 0.9^4

= 216

So, the probability of exactly four voters voting in the last election is approximately 216.

Answer Choices:
A) 58
B) 62
C) 66
D) 70
E) 74
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's start by identifying the dimensions of the yard. Since Alice wants to leave one side unfenced, we know that one side is 10 meters long. Let's call the length of the other two sides x meters.

We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so we can set up the equation:

x + x + 10 = 240

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 10 = 240

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

2x = 230

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 115

So, the length of the two sides of the yard is 115 meters.

Now, we need to find out how much fencing Alice needs. Since she wants to fence three sides, she needs to fence two sides with a total length of 2x + 10 = 230 meters, and one side with a length of 10 meters.

Therefore, the answer is:

E) 1
900
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  The answer is C) 200.

Let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The middle letter must be a vowel.
2. The first letter and the third letter must be different from each other and are both consonants.

We can start with the middle letter as any vowel (A, E, I, O, U).

For the first letter, we have 20 consonants to choose from (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

For the third letter, we have 20 consonants to choose from (B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, P, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z).

Since the first letter and the third letter must be different, we can choose 20 different consonants for each position.

Now, we have 20 x 20 x 20 = 8000 possible codes.

However, we need to subtract the codes that have the same middle letter, as we are looking for unique codes.

Let's assume we have a code like ""ABC"", where ""A"" is the middle letter. We can have 19 different consonants for the first letter and 19 different consonants for the third letter, which gives us 19 x 19 = 364 possible codes with the same middle letter ""A"".

Therefore, we need to subtract 364 from 8000 to get the total number of unique codes:

8000 - 364 = 7636

E) 39
Lets think step by step, end your answer in this format 'The answer is <answer>' [/INST]  Sure! Let's work this out step by step.

We know that the product of three consecutive integers can be expressed as 727 + 728 + 729.

We can start by finding the first integer:

727 + 728 + 729 = 3(x) + 727 + 728 + 729

We can simplify the equation by combining like terms:

3(x) + 727 + 728 + 729 = 3x + 2194

Now we can solve for x:

3x + 2194 = 3(x) + 727 + 728 + 729

Subtracting 3x from both sides gives us:

2194 = 727 + 728 + 729

Now we can find the sum of the three consecutive integers:

The sum of the three consecutive integers is 727 + 728 + 729 = 2194.
