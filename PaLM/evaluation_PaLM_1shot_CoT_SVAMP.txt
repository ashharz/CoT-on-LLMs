ANSWER: ( 732.0 + 682.0 )=1414

QUESTION: Julia played tag with 12 kids on monday. She played tag with 14 kids on tuesday. She spent a total of 34 hours to play tag on both days.How many kids did she play with altogether?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 12.0 + 14.0 )=26
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Julia spent 12 + 14 = 26 hours playing tag with kids on both days. So she played with 26 / 34 * 100 = 76.47% of the time playing tag with kids. So she played with 100 - 76.47 = 23.53% of the time doing other things. So she spent 34 * 23.53 = 79.99 hours doing other things. So she played with 34 - 79.99 = 54.01 hours doing other things. So she played with 54.01 / 2 = 27.005 kids on tuesday. So she played with 12 + 27 = 39 kids altogether. The answer is 39.
