QUESTION: A waiter had some customers. After 9 customers left he still had 12 customers.How many customers did he have at the start?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 9.0 + 12.0 )=21
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 21.

We can solve this question by using the following steps:

1. First, we subtract the number of customers who left from the number of customers who are still there to find the total number of customers who were there at the start: 12 + 9 = 21.

2. Then, we check our answer by making sure that it makes sense. If the waiter had 21 customers at the start and 9 left, then there were 21 - 9 = 12 customers left.

QUESTION: 3 birds were sitting on the fence. 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them.How many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 6.0 - ( 3.0 + 2.0 ) )=1
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 4.

First, we need to find the total number of birds and storks sitting on the fence. There were 3 birds and 6 storks, for a total of 3 + 6 = 9 birds and storks. Then, we need to subtract the number of birds from the total number of birds and storks to find the number of storks. 9 - 3 = 6 storks. Therefore, there are 6 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.

QUESTION: In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girlsHow many pupils are there in that school?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 692.0 + 692.0 ) - 458.0 )=926
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 1150.

We can assume that there are x boys in the school. Then the total number of pupils in the school is x + 692.

We can also assume that the number of boys is y. Then the total number of pupils in the school is x + y.

We know that x + 458 = y. So we can substitute this into the equation x + y = 1150 to get x + x + 458 = 1150. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 458 = 1150. Subtracting 458 from both sides, we get 2x = 692. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 346.

Therefore, there are 346 boys in the school.

The answer is 24.

Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. So the total weight of Marco and his dad's strawberries is 12 + 24 = 36 pounds.

Marco and his dad collected 36 pounds of strawberries. On the way back, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. So the total weight of Marco and his dad's strawberries now is 36 - 8 = 28 pounds.

Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. So the total weight of Marco and his dad's strawberries now is 12 + 24 = 36 pounds.

Marco and his dad collected 36 pounds of strawberries. On the way back, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. So the total weight of Marco and his dad's strawberries now is 36 - 8 = 28 pounds.

Marco's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds. So the total weight of Marco and his dad's strawberries now is 12 + 24 = 36 pounds.

QUESTION: Nell collects cards. She had 309 baseball cards and 356 Ace cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards and Ace cards left.How many more baseball cards than Ace cards does Nell have?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 415.0 - 149.0 )=266
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 60.

Nell had 309 baseball cards + 356 Ace cards = 665 cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 415 baseball cards + Ace cards = 480 cards. So, she gave Jeff 665 cards - 480 cards = 185 cards. So, she has 415 baseball cards - 185 cards = 230 Ace cards. So, Nell has 415 baseball cards - 230 Ace cards = 60 more baseball cards than Ace cards.

QUESTION: Julia played tag with 19 kids on monday. She played tag with 18 kids on tuesday. She spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days.How many more kids did she play with on monday than on tuesday?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 19.0 - 18.0 )=1
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 1.

We can break down the question into steps. First, we need to find the total number of kids Julia played with on both days. We do this by adding the number of kids she played with on Monday (19) to the number of kids she played with on Tuesday (18): 19 + 18 = 37.

Next, we need to subtract the number of kids she played with on Tuesday from the total number of kids she played with to find the number of more kids she played with on Monday than on Tuesday: 37 - 18 = 19.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 1.

QUESTION: He then went to see the oranges being harvested. He found out that they harvest 38 sacks per day and that each sack containes 42 oranges.How many sacks of oranges will they have after 49 days of harvest?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 38.0 * 49.0 )=1862
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 1862.

The question asks how many sacks of oranges will they have after 49 days of harvest. The answer is 1862.

To answer this question, we need to know how many oranges they harvest in 49 days and how many sacks of oranges they will have.

First, we need to know how many oranges they harvest in 49 days. They harvest 38 sacks per day and each sack contains 42 oranges. So, they harvest 38 * 42 = 1606 oranges per day.

Second, we need to know how many sacks of oranges they will have. They harvest 1606 oranges per day and they want to know how many sacks of oranges they will have after 49 days. So, they will have 1606 * 49 = 80574 oranges.

Finally, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of oranges per sack to find the number of sacks of oranges. 80574 / 42 = 1862.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 60.0 / 10.0 )=6

MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 6.

We can use the following steps to solve the problem:

1. First, we need to find out how many flower beds Paige and her mom planted. We know that they planted 60 seeds, and they put 10 seeds in each flower bed. So, we can divide the number of seeds by the number of seeds per flower bed to find the number of flower beds: 60 / 10 = 6.
2. Therefore, the answer is 6.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 148.

To solve this question, we need to know the total number of bottles and the total number of apples. The total number of bottles is 80 + 54 = 134. The total number of apples is 36. So the difference is 134 - 36 = 148.

ANSWER: ( 37.0 - 16.0 )=21
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 23.

The frog jumped 37 + 14 = 51 inches. The mouse jumped 51 - 16 = 35 inches. So the mouse jumped 35 - 14 = 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 408.

We know that Faye has 11 rows of pencils and crayons. And each row has 31 pencils and 27 crayons. So the total number of pencils is 11 * 31 = 341. The total number of crayons is 11 * 27 = 307. So Faye has 341 + 307 = 408 pencils and crayons altogether.

QUESTION: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus.How many buses are needed to take the trip?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 58.0 / 2.0 )=29
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 43.

The school has 58 students in each classroom, and there are 87 classrooms, so the school has 58 * 87 = 5046 students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus, then the school needs 5046 / 2 = 2523 buses. Since it is impossible to have 2523 buses, the school needs 2523 rounded up to 2524 buses.

First find the total number of invitations Carol bought: 14 invitations / pack * 6 packs = 84 invitations.

ANSWER: ( 893835.0 + 644997.0 )=1538832
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 1548900.

We can infer from the question that the total number of kids in Lawrence county is the sum of the number of kids who stayed home and the number of kids who went to camp. We can also infer from the question that the total number of kids at camp is the sum of the number of kids from Lawrence county who went to camp and the number of kids from outside the county who attended the camp. Therefore, the total number of kids in Lawrence county is 644997 + 893835 + 78 = 1548900.

QUESTION: Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a dayHow many days would the soda bottles last?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 360.0 / 9.0 )=40
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 40.

We can think step-by-step.

First, we find out how many bottles Debby has in total: 360 + 162 = 522. Then, we find out how many days the water bottles will last: 162 / 122 = 1.3. Then, we subtract the number of days the water bottles will last from the total number of days to find out how many days the soda bottles will last: 522 - 1.3 = 40.

Thus, the answer is 40.
