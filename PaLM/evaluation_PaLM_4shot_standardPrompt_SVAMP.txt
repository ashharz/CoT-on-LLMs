If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participateHow many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 450.0 + 38.0 )=488
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 488.

We can see that the 5th question is a bit different from the previous 4 questions. It asks about the number of students who participated in the suggestion of new food items. The previous 4 questions all ask about the number of items. So we need to find out how many students suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon to the menu, and then add them together to get the answer.

We know that 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes and 38 students suggested adding bacon. So the total number of students who participated in the suggestion of new food items is 450 + 38 = 488.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 20.0 / 5.0 )=4
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 4.

To answer this question, we need to know how many beads Emily has left after making 5 necklaces. We can subtract the number of necklaces from the total number of beads: 20 beads - 5 necklaces = 15 beads. We then divide the number of beads left by the number of necklaces to find the number of beads per necklace: 15 beads / 5 necklaces = 3 beads / necklace.

**********************************

We know that the total number of bird families is 89. We also know that 60 bird families flew away for winter. Therefore, 89 - 60 = 29 bird families stayed behind.

QUESTION: There were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase.How many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 13.0 - 3.0 )=10
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 10.

First we need to figure out the total number of roses and orchids that Jessica cut from her flower garden. To do this, we add the number of roses that were in the vase before she cut some more roses and orchids (9) to the number of orchids that were in the vase before she cut some more roses and orchids (6). This gives us 9 + 6 = 15 roses and orchids that Jessica cut from her flower garden.

Next, we need to subtract the number of roses that are in the vase now (3) from the total number of roses and orchids that Jessica cut from her flower garden (15). This gives us 15 - 3 = 12 roses that Jessica cut from her flower garden.

Finally, we need to subtract the number of orchids that are in the vase now (13) from the total number of roses and orchids that Jessica cut from her flower garden (12). This gives us 12 - 13 = -1 roses that Jessica cut from her flower garden. Since the answer is negative, this means that Jessica actually added roses to the vase instead of cutting them.

Therefore, the answer to the question is 10.

QUESTION: He also had 26 aquariums for saltwater animals. The aquarium had 52 saltwater animals in total and every aquarium had the same number of animals.How many saltwater animals does each aquarium have?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 52.0 / 26.0 )=2
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 2.

We know that the total number of saltwater animals in the aquarium is 52. We also know that there are 26 aquariums in total. We can divide the total number of saltwater animals by the total number of aquariums to find the number of saltwater animals in each aquarium.

52 / 26 = 2

Therefore, each aquarium has 2 saltwater animals.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 149.0 - 10.0 )=139

MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 139.

The baker made a total of 149 + 91 = 240 pastries and cakes. He sold a total of 10 + 90 = 100 pastries and cakes. So he still has 240 - 100 = 140 cakes.

QUESTION: Dave had 24 files and 13 apps on his phone. After deleting some apps and files he had 17 apps and 21 files left.How many files did he delete?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 24.0 - 21.0 )=3
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 3.

Let me explain:
First, we need to calculate how many apps and files Dave had in total before deleting some: 24 files + 13 apps = 37 apps and files. Then, we need to calculate how many apps and files Dave has left after deleting some: 17 apps + 21 files = 38 apps and files. Finally, we need to subtract the number of apps and files Dave has left from the number of apps and files he had before deleting some to find the number of files he deleted: 37 apps and files - 38 apps and files = 3 files.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 58.0 / 2.0 )=29

MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 29.

The school has 87 classrooms and each classroom has 58 students, so the school has 87 * 58 = 5046 students. If each bus has 2 seats, then the school needs 5046 / 2 = 2523 buses to take the trip. Since there are no buses that can hold 2523 students, the school needs to rent 29 buses to take the trip.

We can calculate the total number of shirts the machine made in all as follows:

The question is asking how many friends Carol can invite. We know that she bought 6 packs of invitations, and each pack had 14 invitations, so she has 6 * 14 = 84 invitations. She also bought 11 extra invitations, so she has 84 + 11 = 95 invitations. Therefore, she can invite 95 friends.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 10.

Let's solve this question step by step.

1. Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill so Jill has 5 - 8 = -3 peaches.
2. Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven who has 5 peaches so Jake has 5 - 3 = 2 peaches.
3. Jake has 2 more peaches than Jill who has -3 peaches so Jake has 2 + (-3) = 10 more peaches than Jill.

Therefore, the answer is 10.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 12.0 - 4.0 )=8
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 63.

We know that Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 12 peaches, so Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 peaches. We also know that Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill, so Jill has 12 - 67 = -55 peaches. Jake has 8 peaches, so Jill has -55 peaches, and Steven has 12 peaches, so in total they have 8 + -55 + 12 = 63 peaches.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 30.

If Jill has 87 peaches, then Steven has 87 + 18 = 105 peaches. If Jake has 5 fewer peaches than Steven, then Jake has 105 - 5 = 100 peaches. So Jake has 100 - 87 = 13 more peaches than Jill.

The first step is to calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks: 13 planks * 17 nails / plank = 221 nails. Then we add the number of nails needed for the smaller planks to get the total number of nails needed: 221 nails + 8 nails = 229 nails.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 18.0 - 11.0 )=7
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 7.

Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches. So in total, he has 11 + 18 = 29 fruits. Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches. Jake also has 10 more apples than Steven, so he has 11 + 10 = 21 apples. So in total, Jake has 21 + 10 = 31 fruits. Therefore, Steven has 29 - 31 = 2 fewer peaches than apples.
