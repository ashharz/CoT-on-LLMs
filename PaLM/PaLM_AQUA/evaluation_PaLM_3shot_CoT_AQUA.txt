QUESTION: A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?['A ) 5 ( √ 3 + 1 )', 'B ) 6 ( √ 3 + √ 2 )', 'C ) 7 ( √ 3 – 1 )', 'D ) 8 ( √ 3 – 2 )', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h . Initially , he was at an angle of 450 . tan 45 = h / distance between car and tower . h = distance between car and tower ( since tan 45 = 1 ) .
Now , after 10 minutes , it travelled a certain distance , and angle changed to 600 .
tan 60 = h / x x = h / √ 3
So , in 10 minutes , it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h / √ 3 .
10 minutes = h * ( 1 – 1 √ 3 )
h can be travelled in 10 / ( 1 – 1 √ 3 ) .
To travel a distance of x , which is h / √ 3 , it takes :
h = 10 / ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 )
h / √ 3 = 10 / √ 3 * ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 ) . Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √ 3 ( conjugate of 1 - √ 3 ) . We get , x = h / √ 3 = 10 ( 1 + √ 3 ) / 2 = 5 * ( 1 + √ 3 )
So , it takes 5 ( 1 + √ 3 ) minutes to reach the base of the tower .
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let the height of the tower be h metres.

In ∆POQ, tan 45° = h/x ⇒ x = h

In ∆PQR, tan 60° = h/(x + 10) ⇒ h/(x + 10) = √3 ⇒ x + 10 = h/√3

∴ Required time = (h/√3 - h)/h * 18/5 = 8(√3 - 2)/5 minutes

The answer is (D).

QUESTION: The original price of an item is discounted 22 % . A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $ 20 - off coupon . There is no tax on the item , and this was the only item the customer bought . If the customer paid $ 1.90 more than half the original price of the item , what was the original price of the item ?['A ) $ 61', 'B ) $ 65', 'C ) $ 67.40', 'D ) $ 70', 'E ) $ 78.20']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let x be the original price of the item
Discounted price = 0.78 x
Payment made by the customer after using the $ 20 coupon = 0.78 x - 20
0.78 x - 20 = x / 2 + 1.9
x = 78.20
Answer : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The original price of the item is $100. After a 22% discount, the price of the item is $100 * (78/100) = $78. The customer used a $20-off coupon, so the price of the item after the coupon is $78 - $20 = $58. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, so the original price of the item is $58 + $1.90 = $60.

The answer is (D).

***********************************
ANSWER: The probability that stock A does not increase is 0.44 , and the probability that stock B does not increase is 0.26 . Now , how can the probability that both do not increase be more than individual probability of not increasing for each ? So the probability that both do not increase can not be more than 0.26 . Basically the probability that both do not increase is between 0 and 0.26 .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B)

P(A ∪ B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - P(A ∩ B)

1.3 = 0.56 + 0.74 - P(A ∩ B)

P(A ∩ B) = 0.22

So the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.22.

If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag , how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold ?['A ) 40', 'B ) 200', 'C ) 380', 'D ) 400', 'E ) 3200']
***********************************
ANSWER: We know that there are 20 black marbles in the bag and this number represent 1 / 20 th of the number of all marbles in the bag , thus there are total Q of 20 * 20 = 400 marbles .
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Initially, the bag contained 20 + 20 = 40 marbles. After painting, the bag contained 40 + 20 = 60 marbles. After pulling out 1 black marble, the bag contained 60 - 1 = 59 marbles. Since 1 marble out of 20 pulled out was black, the bag contains 59 * 100 / 20 = 295 black marbles. Therefore, the bag currently contains 295 + 59 = 354 marbles.

The answer is (C).

What is the total journey duration ?['A ) 10', 'B ) 11.5', 'C ) 12.5', 'D ) 13.5', 'E ) 15']
***********************************
ANSWER: Distance to destination = 100 X 10 = 1000 miles .
Distance remaining when it starts to rain = 1000 - 250 = 750 miles .
Speed for remaining distance = 75 miles / hour .
Time taken to cover remaining distance = 750 / 75 = 10 hours .
Total duration of the journey = 2.5 + 10 = 12.5 hours .
The correct option is C .
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let's think step-by-step.
        The total distance covered is 100 * 10 = 1000 miles. After covering 1 / 4 distance, the distance remaining is 1000 - 1000 / 4 = 750 miles. The time taken to cover the remaining distance at 75 miles / hour is 750 / 75 = 10 hours. So the total journey duration is 10 + 10 = 20 hours.

***********************************
ANSWER: To maximize the number of students who did neither , we should minimize the number of students who debated or attended the prom .
Let ' s assume that all 35 % of students who debated also attended the prom .
Then 35 % did both , 10 % only attended prom , and 55 % did neither .
0.55 * 200 = 110
The answer is E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The number of students who attended the prom night = 45% of 200 = 90.
The number of students who took part in the debating session = 35% of 200 = 70.
The number of students who attended both the prom night and the debating session = 90 + 70 = 160.
The maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session = 200 – 160 = 40.

QUESTION: A sales person gets a 10 % commission on each sale he makes . How many sales of $ 250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $ 1000 ?['A ) 15', 'B ) 24', 'C ) 25', 'D ) 40', 'E ) 52']
***********************************
ANSWER: 10 % of 250 = 25 .
Total salary required = 1000
Earning from single sale = 25
# of sales = 1000 / 25 = 40
So 40 sales
D is the correct choice
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The answer is (B) 24.

        A sales person gets 10 / 100 * 250 = $25 for each sale. So he needs to make 1000 / 25 = 40 sales. But he can only make 40 sales in 40 / 2.5 = 16 weeks. So he needs to make 40 sales in 16 weeks which means he needs to make 40 / 16 = 2.5 sales per week. So he needs to make 2.5 sales per week for 4 weeks which means he needs to make 2.5 * 4 = 10 sales in 4 weeks. So he needs to make 10 + 4 = 14 sales in 4 weeks. But he can only make 250 sales in 250 / 2.5 = 100 weeks. So he needs to make 14 sales in 100 weeks which means he needs to make 14 / 100 = 0.14 sales per week. So he needs to make 0.14 * 4 = 0.56 sales in 4 weeks. So he needs to make 14 + 0.56 = 14.56 sales in 4 weeks. So he needs to make 15 sales in 4 weeks.

QUESTION: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month , at a production cost to the company of $ 110 per component , and sells all of the components by the end of each month . What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit ( revenue from sales minus production costs ) will be at least $ 626,400 ?['A ) 226', 'B ) 230', 'C ) 240', 'D ) 260', 'E ) 280']
***********************************
ANSWER: 450 * 12 ( x - 110 ) = 626400
where x is a selling cost of one item
x - 110 , is a profit from one item
450 - number of items produced and sold per month
12 - is a number of month in a year
Simplifying the equation will lead to x - 110 = 116 , then x = 230
B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (D).

The yearly profit is the revenue from sales minus the production costs. The revenue from sales is 420 units * $260 per unit = $109,200. The production costs are 420 units * $110 per unit = $46,200. So the yearly profit is $109,200 - $46,200 = $62,600. The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $626,400 / 420 units = $150 per unit. The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $150 per unit. But the question asks for the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400. So the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $150 per unit.

***********************************
ANSWER: We ' re told that 10 % of staplers in a factory are defective .
X = Total staplers
0.1 X = defective staplers
0.9 X = normal staplers
Next , we ' re told that 2 % of the normal staplers were rejected by mistake and that this = 72 staplers .
0.9 X ( 0.02 ) = 72
0.018 X = 72
18 X = 72,000
X = 4,000
Final Answer :
A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the total number of staplers produced = x

Number of defective staplers = 10/100 * x = x/10

Number of non - defective staplers = x - x/10 = 9x/10

Number of non - defective staplers rejected = 2/100 * 9x/10 = 9x/500

72 = 9x/500

x = 72 * 500/9 = 4,200

So, the answer is (B).

x = 147 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs . and y is 135 hrs . Thus total toys created by Jacob = y / 9 = 135 / 9 = 15 .
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's think step-by-step.

Let's say Alex worked for x hours and Jacob worked for y hours. We know that x + y = 35 hours and 7x = 9y. We can substitute the second equation into the first equation to get 7x + 7x = 35 hours. Combining like terms, we get 14x = 35 hours. Dividing both sides by 14, we get x = 2.5 hours. Substituting this value back into the equation 7x = 9y, we get 7(2.5) = 9y. Simplifying, we get 17.5 = 9y. Dividing both sides by 9, we get y = 1.91666667. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get y = 2 hours. Therefore, Jacob made 35 toys / 2 hours = 17 toys.

QUESTION: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening . In a 50 % strong milk tea , he replaces 15 % of it with milk twice . Then , he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk .
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks ?['A ) 15.38 %', 'B ) 42 %', 'C ) 39.86 %', 'D ) 22.35 %', 'E ) 32.51 %']
***********************************
ANSWER: Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50 % milk tea .
In step 1 , 15 % of the tea is replaced with milk . Thus , 85 % of the original tea remains . Since this is done twice , we have a concentration of 50 x 0.85 x 0.85 % ( = 36.125 % ) of tea solution .
Finally , 10 % of this solution is replaced with milk again . So , the final concentration of tea is 36.125 * 0.9 %
This equals 32.51 % of tea solution .
Answer : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Initially, concentration of tea = 50%
After replacing 15% of tea with milk, concentration of tea = 85/100 * 50/100 = 42%
After replacing 15% of the resultant solution with milk, concentration of tea = 85/100 * 42/100 = 35.7%
After replacing 10% of the resultant solution with milk, concentration of tea = 85/100 * 35.7/100 = 30.55%

QUESTION: In a class 1 / 16 of the students study math , 1 / 10 of the students study bio , 1 / 8 of the students study english . The total number of students is a 4 digit number . Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students .['A ) 8880', 'B ) 8870', 'C ) 8890', 'D ) 7890', 'E ) 6780']
***********************************
ANSWER: LCM of 16 , 10,8 = 80
the largest 4 digit number divisible by 80 = 9920
The smallest 4 digit number divisible by 80 = 1040
So , required difference = 9920 - 1040 = 8880
ANSWER : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Let's think step-by-step.
Let the total number of students be x.
Number of students studying math = x/16
Number of students studying bio = x/10
Number of students studying english = x/8
Total number of students = x/16 + x/10 + x/8 = 13x/48
Maximum number of students = 16*13x/48 = 52x/12 = 43x/6
Minimum number of students = 8*13x/48 = 104x/48 = 26x/12 = 13x/6
Difference between maximum and minimum number of students = 43x/6 - 13x/6 = 30x/6 = 5x
Since the total number of students is a 4 digit number , the maximum number of students is 9999
So , the maximum number of students = 9999
The minimum number of students = 9999 - 5x
Since 5x is a multiple of 6 , the minimum number of students will be a multiple of 6
So , the minimum number of students = 9999 - 6 = 9993
The difference between maximum and minimum number of students = 9999 - 9993 = 6
So , the answer is (E).

QUESTION: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates , and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours . Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses , working together , then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours . How many hours would it have taken hose B , working alone , to fill the entire pool ?['A ) 8', 'B ) 15', 'C ) 12', 'D ) 6', 'E ) 3']
***********************************
ANSWER: Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours , then in 2 + 3 = 5 hours it will fill 5 / 8 th of the pool . Thus the remaining 3 / 8 th is filled by hose B in 3 hours . This means that hose B , working alone , to fill the entire pool will need 3 * 8 / 3 = 8 hours .
Answer : A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's say hose B can fill the pool in x hours. So, in 1 hour, hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool, and hose B can fill 1/x of the pool. In 2 hours, hose A can fill 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool. So, in the remaining 3 hours, hoses A and B can fill 3(1/8 + 1/x) = 3(1/4 + 1/x) = 3(1 + 1/x) = 3 + 3/x of the pool. So, in total, hoses A and B can fill 1/4 + 3 + 3/x = 1 + 3/x of the pool. Since the pool is full, we can say that 1 + 3/x = 1. So, 3/x = 0. Therefore, x = 3. So, it would have taken hose B 3 hours to fill the entire pool.

**The answer is (E).**

ANSWER: Let the number be x
10 x + 1 = 3 ( 100,000 + x )
= > x = 42857 .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Let's say the 5 digit number is abcd.
Then, with a 1 before it, we get 1abcd.
With a 1 after it, we get abcd1.
The question states that abcd1 is three times as large as 1abcd.
This means that 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + 1 = 3(10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10a + 1).
Simplifying this equation, we get 9999a - 29999b = 0.
This means that a = 29999b.
Substituting this back into the original equation, we get 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 1 = 3(29999b + 1000c + 100d + 1).
Simplifying this equation, we get 19999b - 19999c = 0.
This means that b = c.
Substituting this back into the original equation, we get 10000b + 1000b + 100b + 1 = 3(30000b + 100b + 1).
Simplifying this equation, we get 40001b = 30001b + 3.
This means that b = 3.
Substituting this back into the original equation, we get 10000b + 1000b + 100b + 1 = 3(30000b + 100b + 1).
Simplifying this equation, we get 40001b = 30001b + 3.
This means that b = 3.
Substituting this back into the original equation, we get 10000b + 1000b + 100b + 1 = 3(30000b + 100b + 1).
Simplifying this equation, we get 40001b = 30001b + 3.
This means that b = 3.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's solve this problem step-by-step.

The distance traveled by the first car is 12 mph * t = 12t miles. The distance traveled by the second car is 13 mph * t = 13t miles. Since the two cars start at the same time and meet at the same point, the total distance traveled by both cars is 12t + 13t = 25t miles. Since the total distance traveled is 50 miles, then 25t = 50 miles. Dividing both sides by 25, we get t = 50 / 25 = 2 hours.

The final answer: E).

QUESTION: A hollow cube of size 5 cm is taken , with the thickness of 1 cm . It is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm . If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted ?['A ) 438', 'B ) 550', 'C ) 500', 'D ) 450', 'E ) 498']
***********************************
ANSWER: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L 3 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 cm 3
Size of hollow cube ( considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3 cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 cm 3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm 3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 cm 3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes ( 6 faces each cube has ) = 98 * 6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6 * L 2 = 6 * 5 * 5 = 150 cm 2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1 * 1 = 1 cm 2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150 / 1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted = 588 - 150
= 438
answer . A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The outer surface of the hollow cube is 6 * 6 = 36 sq cm. The inner surface of the hollow cube is 4 * 4 = 16 sq cm. So, the total surface area of the smaller cubes is 36 + 16 = 52 sq cm. So, each smaller cube has 52 / 6 = 8.66 sq cm surface area. So, each smaller cube has 6 faces of 1 sq cm each and 2 faces of 0.66 sq cm each. So, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 6 * 6 = 36.

So, the answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let its breadth be = x m .
So length will be = ( 4 x + 1 ) m .
Now ,
x * ( 4 x + 1 ) = 150
or , 4 x ^ 2 + x - 150 = 0
or , ( 4 x + 25 ) ( x - 6 ) = 0
Either 4 x = - 25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4 * 6 + 1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2 * ( 25 + 6 ) = 62 mLet its breadth be = x m .
So length will be = ( 4 x + 1 ) m .
Now ,
x * ( 4 x + 1 ) = 150
or , 4 x ^ 2 + x - 150 = 0
or , ( 4 x + 25 ) ( x - 6 ) = 0
Either 4 x = - 25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4 * 6 + 1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2 * ( 25 + 6 ) = 62 m
ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        
        Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be x m.

Then, the length of the rectangular piece = (4x + 1) m.

The area of the rectangular piece = 150 sq m

⇒ (4x + 1)x = 150

⇒ 4x2 + x – 150 = 0

⇒ x2 + 5x – 150 = 0

⇒ (x + 15)(x – 10) = 0

⇒ x = 10 or x = -15

Since, length cannot be negative, x = 10

∴ Breadth of the rectangular piece = 10 m

∴ Length of the rectangular piece = (4 × 10) + 1 = 41 m

∴ Perimeter of the rectangular piece = 2(10 + 41) = 102 m

∴ The answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let the speed of the ship = m miles / hr . and plane took ' t ' hours to meet the ship
Then , m × t is the distance ship traveled after plane started
So we have , mt + 180 = 10 mt
⇒ 9 mt = 180
⇒ mt = 20
Hence distance = 180 + 20 = 200 miles
Answer : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the speed of ship be S

Speed of plane = 10S

Distance covered by ship in t time = 180

Distance covered by plane in t time = 10S*t

180 + 10S*t = S*t

10S*t = 180

t = 18/10 = 1.8 hours

Total distance covered = S*1.8 = 1.8S miles

The answer is (C).

QUESTION: In a large forest , 300 deer were caught , tagged , and returned during 2001 . During 2002 , 500 deer were caught at random , of which only 20 had tags from the previous year . If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags , what is the total deer population in the forest ( assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002 ) ?['A ) 300', 'B ) 500', 'C ) 5000', 'D ) 6000', 'E ) 7500']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let N = the total number of deer in the forest .
During the first year , the percent of deer in the entire population with tags was : 300 / N
20 / 500 is the percent of deer caught during the second year that had tags . Since this sample percent matches the percent for the entire population ( i . e . , the total number of tagged deer divided by the total number of deer ) , the two ratios are equal .
Equating these two percents :
Sample = Population
( 20 / 500 ) = ( 300 / N )
N = ( 300 / 1 ) * ( 500 / 20 )
N = 7500
Answer E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The total number of deer in the forest in 2001 is 300. The number of deer in the forest in 2002 with tags is 20. The total number of deer in the forest in 2002 is 500. The fraction of deer in the forest in 2002 with tags is 20 / 500 = .04. The total number of deer in the forest in 2002 is 300 * .04 = 12. The total number of deer in the forest in 2001 is 300 + 12 = 312. The answer is (E).

QUESTION: Boomtown urban planners expect the city ’ s population to increase by 10 % per year over the next two years . If that projection were to come true , the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago . Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year ?['A ) 20 %', 'B ) 40 %', 'C ) 50 %', 'D ) 65 %', 'E ) 75 %']
***********************************
ANSWER: Population now - 100 ;
Population one year from now - 110 ;
Population two years from now - 121 ;
Since the population two years from now ( 121 ) is exactly double the population one year ago then the population one year ago was 121 / 2 = 60.5 .
Now , the question asks about the population increase over the last year , so from 60.5 ( last year ) to 100 ( now ) : percent increase = difference / original * 100 = ( 100 - 60.5 ) / 60.5 * 100 = 39.5 / 60.5 * 100 = ~ 2 / 3 * 100 = ~ 65 % .
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's say the current population of Boomtown is 100. If the population increases by 10% per year, then the population after one year will be 100 * 1.1 = 110. If the population doubles in two years, then the population after two years will be 100 * 2 = 200. So the population increased by 200 - 110 = 90 over the last year. The percentage increase is therefore 90 / 110 = 82%, which is closest to 80%. So the answer is (B).

***********************************
ANSWER: Suppose Arun has $ X and Sajal has $ Y . then ,
2 ( x - 30 ) = y + 30 = > 2 x - y = 90 … ( i )
and x + 10 = 3 ( y - 10 ) = > x - 3 y = - 40 … ( ii )
Solving ( i ) and ( ii ) , we get x = 62 and y = 34 .
Arun has $ 62 and Sajal has $ 34 .
Answer B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Let the amount of money with Arjun be x and Sajal be y.
If Arjun gives $ 30 to Sajal , the Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun , ie. y = 2(x - 30) .
But , if Sajal gives $ 10 to Arjun , Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal , ie. x = 3(y - 10) .
Substituting the value of y in the second equation , we get x = 3(2(x - 30) - 10) = 3(2x - 70 - 10) = 6x - 230
Equating this to the first equation , we get 6x - 230 = 2(x - 30)
or 6x - 230 = 2x - 60
or 4x = 170
or x = 42
Substituting this value of x in the first equation , we get y = 2(42 - 30) = 62

The answer: 'E ) 62 , 42'

***********************************
ANSWER: Let x be the length of one side of the original square .
The area of the rectangle is x ( x - 4 ) = 140 .
x = 14 .
The perimeter of the square was 4 * 14 = 56 feet .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's think step-by-step.

Let the side of the square be x.

After trimming, the length of the rectangle is x - 4 and the breadth is x.

Area of each triangle = 1 / 2 * x * (x - 4) = 70

x * (x - 4) = 140

x2 - 4x - 140 = 0

(x - 10) (x + 14) = 0

x = 10 or -14

Since x cannot be negative, x = 10

Perimeter of the original square = 4 * 10 = 40

***********************************
ANSWER: Length of ribbon originally = 30 cm
Let the original length be 5 x and reduced length be 3 x .
But 5 x = 30 cm
x = 30 / 5 cm = 6 cm
Therefore , reduced length = 3 cm
= 3 × 6 cm = 18 cm
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: 

Chain-of-thought:

Let's say the ribbon was reduced by x cm. So, the original length = 30 - x cm. The new length = 30 - (5/3)x = 15 - x cm. Since the new length is 15 - x cm and the original length is 30 - x cm, we can say that 15 - x / 30 - x = 5 / 3. Cross-multiplying, we get 45 - 3x = 150 - 5x. Combining like terms, we get -2x = -105. Dividing both sides by -2, we get x = 52.5 cm. Since the ribbon was reduced by 52.5 cm, its new length is 30 - 52.5 = 7.5 cm.

The answer should be C

QUESTION: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba , if M > N and M - N + 396 c = 990 . Then how many values of M are more than 300 .['A ) 20', 'B ) 30', 'C ) 40', 'D ) 200', 'E ) None']
***********************************
ANSWER: From the given data ,
abc – cba + 396 c = 990
100 a + 10 b + c – ( 100 c + 10 b + a ) + 396 c = 990
99 a – 99 c + 396 c = 990
Observe that each term is divisible by 99 . So on dividing the above expression by 99 , we get
a – c + 4 c = 10
a + 3 c = 10
For c = 1 , a = 7
c = 2 , a = 4
c = 3 , a = 1
' b ' can take any value from 0 to 9
We have to find the value of M more than 300 . So minimum value of ' a ' should be 4 .
So total possibilities are 402 , 412 , . . . . , 492 = 10 values
701 , 711 , . . . . . , 791 = 10 values
So total values = 20 .
Correct option : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let's think step-by-step.

1. Given that M > N and M - N + 396 c = 990, we can infer that M - N = 990 - 396 c.
2. Since M and N are three-digit numbers, they must be in the range of 100 to 999.
3. This means that M - N must be in the range of 0 to 899.
4. Since 396 c is a multiple of 396, it must also be in the range of 0 to 899.
5. This means that M - N + 396 c must be in the range of 0 to 1795.
6. Since 990 is the only number in the range of 0 to 1795 that is divisible by 396, we can conclude that M - N = 990 - 396 c = 990.
7. This means that M = N + 990.
8. Since N is a three-digit number, it must be in the range of 100 to 999.
9. This means that M is in the range of 1090 to 1999.
10. Since we are only interested in values of M that are more than 300, we can conclude that there are 200 values of M that are more than 300.

QUESTION: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed . When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs . 1800 . In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs . 2040 . In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays . The bill for that month would be :['A ) Rs . 1560', 'B ) Rs . 1680', 'C ) Rs . 1840', 'D ) Rs . 1950', 'E ) Rs . 1690']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let the fixed amount be Rs . X and the cost of each unit be Rs . Y .
Then , 540 y + x = 1800 … . And 620 y + x = 2040
On subtracting ( i ) from ( ii ) , we get 80 y = 240 - > y = 3
Putting y = 3 in ( i ) we get :
540 * 3 + x = 1800 x = ( 1800 - 1620 ) = 180
. : Fixed charges = Rs . 180 , Charge per unit = Rs . 3 .
Total charges for consuming 500 units = 180 + ( 500 * 3 ) = Rs . 1680
Answer : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let the fixed charge be Rs. x and the charge per call be Rs. y.

Then, 540y + x = 1800 and 620y + x = 2040

Subtracting, we get 80y = 240

⇒ y = 3

∴ x = 1800 – 540 × 3 = 600

∴ The bill for 500 calls = 500 × 3 + 600 = 1680.

The answer: B.

QUESTION: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track . Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes . Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes . If they start rotating now from the same point , when will they be at the same starting point again ?['A ) 1 hour and 31 minutes', 'B ) 2 hour and 31 minutes', 'C ) 3 hour and 31 minutes', 'D ) 4 hour and 31 minutes', 'E ) 5 hour and 31 minutes']
***********************************
ANSWER: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes , it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes . If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes , it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes .
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points . Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations . Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T . Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point . Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13 . The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13 . Hence
X = 7 ( 13 ) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes
correct answer A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The time taken by ball A to complete one rotation = 26/2 = 13 minutes
The time taken by ball B to complete one rotation = 35/5 = 7 minutes

The LCM of 13 and 7 = 91 minutes

Hence, they will be at the same starting point again after 91 minutes.

The answer is (A).

QUESTION: A newspaper costs $ 4 on Sunday and $ 1 the rest of the days of the week . If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $ 210 per week for newspapers , how many newspapers does it buy on Monday ?['A ) 15', 'B ) 30', 'C ) 45', 'D ) 60', 'E ) 75']
***********************************
ANSWER: Number of paper bought on monday = x
# of paper bought on sunday = 2 x
Total cost = 210 = 6 * x ( rest of the day cost ) + 8 * x ( sunday cost )
14 x = 210
x = 15
Ans A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's say the hotel buys x newspapers on Monday. Then, it buys 2x newspapers on Sunday. So, the hotel buys a total of 2x + x = 3x newspapers per week. The cost of the newspapers on Sunday is 4 * 2x = 8x dollars. The cost of the newspapers on Monday is 1 * x = x dollars. So, the total cost of the newspapers is 8x + x = 9x dollars. Since the hotel pays $210 for newspapers, we have 9x = 210. So, x = 210 / 9 = 23. Therefore, the hotel buys 23 newspapers on Monday.

**The answer is (B).**

***********************************
ANSWER: Let the number of persons be x . Then ,
96 / x - 4 - 96 / x = 4 = > x = 12
So , required number = x - 4 = 8 .
Answer is A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the number of friends who attended the picnic = x
Total amount spent by the x friends = Rs 96
Amount spent by each friend = Rs 96/x
Amount spent by 4 friends who did not turn up = Rs 4x
Total amount spent by all the friends = 96/x + 4x = 96 + 4x
Since the total amount spent by all the friends is same as the amount planned to be spent, we have 96 + 4x = 96
=> 4x = 0
=> x = 0
But this is not possible as the number of friends cannot be 0
=> x = 4

The number of friends who attended the picnic = 4

The answer is (D).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let x = red sweets
Write the items in the ratio as a fraction .
red / green = 3 / 4 = x / 120
3 × 120 = 4 × x
360 = 4 x
x = 360 / 4 = 90
Answer : A

***********************************
ANSWER: Starting from 1 Water Lilly it takes 60 days .
If there are already two present , it can be taken as the first day is over .
It will take 59 more days .
Notice that we are told thatthe number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days , thus if initially there were 64 water lilies instead of one , we can consider that 7 days are over and therefore only 53 days are left .
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let's answer step-by-step.

Let's say the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies is 'x'.

If initially there were 64 water lilies on it, then the number of water lilies on the lake doubles every two days for 'x - 1' days.

So, the number of water lilies on the lake after 'x - 1' days = 64 * 2^(x - 1)

But, if there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

So, 64 * 2^(x - 1) = 1

=> 2^(x - 1) = 1 / 64

=> x - 1 = log2(1 / 64)

=> x - 1 = log2(0.015625)

=> x - 1 = -4

=> x = 1 + 4 = 5.

The answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: 36 ≤ n ≤ 72
x = ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( n + 4 √ n + 4 )
Put x = 36 ,
x = ( 362 + 2 √ 36 ( 36 + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 36 + 4 √ 36 + 4 )
i . e which is least value for n = 28 .
Answer : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's solve the question step-by-step.

1. We can first simplify the expression x by expanding the numerator and denominator.

```
x = ( n^2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( n + 4 √ n + 4 )
= ( n^2 + 2 n^2 + 8 n + 16 ) / ( n + 4 √ n + 4 )
= ( 3 n^2 + 8 n + 16 ) / ( n + 4 √ n + 4 )
```

2. Now, we can substitute the values of n from 36 to 72 into the expression x.

```
n = 36: x = ( 36^2 + 8 * 36 + 16 ) / ( 36 + 4 * √36 + 4 )
= ( 1296 + 304 + 16 ) / ( 40 + 4 * 6 + 4 )
= 1624 / 50 = 32.48

n = 37: x = ( 37^2 + 8 * 37 + 16 ) / ( 37 + 4 * √37 + 4 )
= ( 1369 + 300 + 16 ) / ( 41 + 4 * 6.08 + 4 )
= 1705 / 50 = 34.1

n = 38: x = ( 38^2 + 8 * 38 + 16 ) / ( 38 + 4 * √38 + 4 )
= ( 1444 + 344 + 16 ) / ( 42 + 4 * 6.24 + 4 )
= 1804 / 50 = 36.08

...

n = 72: x = ( 72^2 + 8 * 72 + 16 ) / ( 72 + 4 * √72 + 4 )
= ( 5184 + 576 + 16 ) / ( 76 + 4 * 8.48 + 4 )
= 5824 / 80 = 72.8
```

3. We can then plot the values of x for each value of n on a graph.

![Graph of x vs. n](https://i.imgur.com/577018l.png)

4. From the graph, we can see that the values of x for n from 36 to 72 are all between 20 and 54.

5. Therefore, the final answer is (A).

It means C was there in the business for 6 months . Given that B joined the business
after 2 months . Hence C joined after 4 months after B joined
Answer is B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's solve the question step-by-step.

(A + B + C)'s 1 month's share = 40000/12 + 60000/12 + 120000/12 = 15000
(A + B)'s 11 months' share = 15000 * 11 = 165000
So, C's 3 months' share = 375000 - 165000 = 210000
So, C joined after 210000/15000 = 14 months after B joined.

The final answer: B ).

QUESTION: 64 boys and 40 girls form a group for social work . During their membership drive , the same number of boys and girls joined the group . How many members does the group have now , if the ratio of boys to girls is 4 : 3 ?['A ) 277', 'B ) 288', 'C ) 200', 'D ) 277', 'E ) 168']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let us say x boys and x girls joined the group .
( 64 + x ) / ( 40 + x ) = 4 / 3
192 + 3 x = 160 + 4 x = > x = 32
Number of members in the group = 64 + x + 40 + x
= 104 + 2 x = 168 .
Answer : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's first find the total number of members in the group before the membership drive:

64 boys + 40 girls = 104 members

Now, let's say x is the number of boys and y is the number of girls who joined the group during the membership drive. Since the ratio of boys to girls is 4:3, we know that x / y = 4 / 3. We can also write this equation as 3x = 4y.

We can now substitute this equation into the equation for the total number of members in the group after the membership drive:

(64 + x) + (40 + y) = 104 + x + y

104 + 3x + 4y = 104 + x + y

2x + 3y = 0

We can now solve this equation for y:

y = -2x / 3

We can now substitute this equation into the equation for the ratio of boys to girls:

x / (-2x / 3) = 4 / 3

-3x / 2x = 4 / 3

-3 / 2 = 4 / 3

This equation is not solvable, so it is impossible to find the number of members in the group after the membership drive.

Therefore, the answer is (E).

$ 3.40 - $ 0.20 * 2 = $ 3.00 , which is a multiple of $ 0.25 .
The answer is C .
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The answer is (D).

        Let's think step-by-step.

        The total amount she got is 3.40 * 100 = 340 cents. If she brought 4 copper coins, she got 4 * 20 = 80 cents. If she brought 3 copper coins, she got 3 * 20 = 60 cents. If she brought 2 copper coins, she got 2 * 20 = 40 cents. If she brought 1 copper coin, she got 1 * 20 = 20 cents. Since she got 340 cents, she must have brought 340 / 20 = 17 copper coins. Since the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 17, the answer is (D).

How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other ?['A ) 3 hours', 'B ) 5 hours', 'C ) 6 hours', 'D ) 4 hours', 'E ) 7 hours']
***********************************
ANSWER: Relative Speed : 55 - 52 = 3 mph
Distance : 15 miles
Time : distance / speed = 15 / 3 = 5 hours
Correct answer is B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The first car travels 55 miles per hour, so after 1 hour, it will have traveled 55 miles. The second car travels 52 miles per hour, so after 1 hour, it will have traveled 52 miles. In 1 hour, the distance between the two cars will be 55 miles - 52 miles = 3 miles. Therefore, it will take 3 hours for the distance between the two cars to reach 15 miles.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Let d be the distance between the two cars, and t be the time in hours.
2. The first car travels at a rate of 55 miles per hour, so after t hours, it will have traveled 55t miles.
3. The second car travels at a rate of 52 miles per hour, so after t hours, it will have traveled 52t miles.
4. The distance between the two cars is 55t - 52t = 3t miles.
5. When the distance between the two cars is 15 miles, t = 15 / 3 = 5 hours.
6. Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the distance between the two cars to reach 15 miles.

Area of 4 walls = ( 65 + 15 ) = 80 m 2
2 ( length + breadth ) * height = 80 .
Therefore , 2 * 5 x * 2 x = 80 or x 2 = 4 or x = 2
Therefore , height of the room = 4 m
ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The answer is: (C ) 4 m

        Step-by-step explanation:
        Let the semi - perimeter of the room be 'x' m .
        Then , the perimeter of the room = 2x m
        The area of the walls of the room = 2x * h = 2xh m2
        The area of the paper used = 2xh - 15 = 2xh - 15 m2
        The cost of the paper = 2 ( 2xh - 15 ) = 4xh - 30
        Given that 4xh - 30 = 260
        So , 4xh = 260 + 30 = 290
        So , h = 290/4 = 72.5
        So , the height of the room = 72.5 cm = 4 m.

***********************************
ANSWER: The mixture contains 3 kg sand and 7 kg clay .
For the mixture to be in equal quantities , there should be 2 kg of clay removed .
Clay and sand are in the ratio 7 : 3
So part of sand to be removed = 2 * 3 / 7 = 6 / 7
So total mixture to be removed = 2 + 6 / 7 = 20 / 7

QUESTION: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each . What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased ?['A ) 9 Trousers', 'B ) 8 Trousers', 'C ) 10 Trousers', 'D ) 7 Trousers', 'E ) 11 Trousers']
***********************************
ANSWER: Lets assume S as price of shirt and T as price of trousers , we have bellow equation :
70 T + 30 S = 810
Simplifying we get : 7 T + 3 S = 81
T = ( 81 - 3 * S ) / 7
We need to find the least value of S which will make ( 81 - 3 * S ) divisible by 7
Simplifying by taking 3 as common factor 3 * ( 27 - S ) / 7
Looking at the above equation its not difficult to find out least value of S is 6 so that 27 - 3 S becomes divisible by S
Hence , T = ( 81 - 3 * S ) / 7 = ( 81 - 3 * 6 ) / 7 = 63 / 7 = 9
ANSWER : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's say the man bought x trousers and y shirts. Then, 70x + 30y = 810.

We need to find the maximum possible value of x.

To do this, we need to minimize y.

The minimum possible value of y is 0.

Substituting y = 0 into the equation 70x + 30y = 810, we get 70x = 810.

Dividing both sides by 70, we get x = 11.

Therefore, the man bought 11 trousers and 0 shirts.

The ratio of trousers to shirts is 11 : 0.

The answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Total distance 126 km
in an hour both Allen and Bob covered 126 km
that is 54 + 78 = 132
they meet for the first time Bob covered more KM than Allen . 78 - 54 = 24 .
so when they meet for the second time Bob covered 24 * 2 = 48 more km ( ANSWER E )
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the distance between X and Y be d km.

Time taken by Allen to travel from X to Y = d/54 hours
Time taken by Bob to travel from Y to X = d/78 hours

Time taken by Allen to travel from Y to X = d/54 hours
Time taken by Bob to travel from X to Y = d/78 hours

Total time taken by both of them to meet again = d/54 + d/78 = 7d/132 hours

Distance covered by Bob in 7d/132 hours = 78 * 7d/132 = 48d/132 km

Distance covered by Allen in 7d/132 hours = 54 * 7d/132 = 36d/132 km

48d/132 - 36d/132 = 48 km

So, the distance between X and Y is 48 km.

The answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Average cost of new tire = $ 45 / tire
cost of repairing the current tire = $ 40 / tire
new tire is $ 5 more per tire .
i e . 5 / 40 = 1 / 8 = 12.5 %
ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The cost of new tires per year is 180 / 4 = $45. The cost of repairing the current tires per year is 40 / 5 = $8. The average cost per year of the new tires is 45 - 8 = $37. The average cost per year of the new tires is 37 / 40 * 100 = 92.5 % of the cost of repairing the current tires. So the average cost per year of the new tires is 92.5 - 100 = 7.5 % greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. The answer is (A).

***********************************
ANSWER: Length of the rope = 20 meters .
Assume length of longer piece = x meters .
Length of shorter piece = x - 3
We know that x + x - 3 = 20
2 x = 23
Length of the longer piece = x = 11.5 meters
Correct Option : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the length of the longer piece of rope be x. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is (x - 3). The total length of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters. So, x + (x - 3) = 20. Combining like terms, we get 2x - 3 = 20. Adding 3 to both sides, we get 2x = 23. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 11.5. The answer is (D).

***********************************
ANSWER: A = P ( 1 + r / q ) nq . Here q is no of times interest is compounded in a yr so it is = 2 . Amount comes out to be 5618 . Hence interest is 5618 - 5000 = 618 . > > B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is: (B)

A step-by-step solution:

The interest rate is 12% / 2 = 6% per 6 months. So the interest earned in 6 months is 5000 * 6 / 100 = $300. So the value of the bond after 6 months is 5000 + 300 = $5300. So the interest earned in the next 6 months is 5300 * 6 / 100 = $318. So the total interest earned is 300 + 318 = $618.

QUESTION: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $ 20 000 with terms 4 / 30 , n / 100 . What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount ?['A ) 247.67', 'B ) 237.67', 'C ) 227.67', 'D ) 215.67', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Explanation :
Suppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4 % of $ 20 000 = $ 800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice . He needs to borrow $ 20 000 = $ 800 = $ 19 200 . He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 ( the day the original invoice is due ) resulting in a 70 - day loan . The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $ 800 .
r = I / pt = 21.73 %
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73 % . This is a break - even rate . If he can borrow money , say at a rate of 15 % , he should do so . He would borrow $ 19 200 for 70 days at 15 % . Maturity value of the loan is $ 19 200 ( 1 + 0.15 ( 70 / 365 ) ) = $ 19 752.33
savings would be $ 20 000 − $ 19 752.33 = $ 247.67
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's solve step-by-step.

Discount = 20000*4/100 = 800

Simple interest = (20000*30*r)/100 = 600r

800 = 600r

r = 800/600 = 4/3%

The answer is (A).

***********************************
ANSWER: The cost of adding one soda and one energy bar is 150 cents . We need to purchase six sodas and seven bars . We know two sodas and three bars costs 300 cents , so to that purchase , we ' d need to add four sodas and four bars - or four sets of items . So , we take the initial 300 + ( 4 * 150 ) = 300 + 600 = 900 .
Answer - E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's say the cost of one soda is x and the cost of one energy bar is y. Then, we have the following equations:

```
x + 2y = 150
2x + 3y = 300
```

Solving these equations, we get x = 50 and y = 25. Therefore, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6x + 7y = 6(50) + 7(25) = 500 + 175 = 675 cents.

The answer is (C).

QUESTION: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens . Company knows that on average 10 % of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing . Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs . 10 each . It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25 % . What is the manufactured cost of each pen ?['A ) Rs . 6', 'B ) Rs . 7.2', 'C ) Rs . 5.6', 'D ) Rs . 8', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: The company is able to deliver 90 % of the manufactured pens . Means to produce 7200 pens they must have to produce 8000 pens as 10 % are defectives . So , let K be the manufacturing price of each pen .
Total income ( including 25 % profit ) = 8000 * K * 1.25
This same income is obtained by selling 90 % manufactured pens at Rs . 10 which is equal to 7200 * 10 .
Thus ,
8000 * K * 1.25 = 7200 * 10
K = Rs . 7.2 . [ 90 % of 8000 = 7200 ]
Answer : Option B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

10 % of the total pens are defective so the number of good pens is 7200 * 90 / 100 = 6480 . So the total cost of the good pens is 6480 * 10 = Rs . 64800 . So the cost of each good pen is 64800 / 6480 = Rs . 10 . So the cost of each pen before profit is 10 / 125 * 100 = Rs . 8 .

Find Mohan ' s share .['A ) 2400', 'B ) 2500', 'C ) 2600', 'D ) 2700', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let , the amount Mohan and Sohan receive be Rs . m and Rs . n , respectively . The amount that they receive 3 years and 2 years after should be equal .
⇒ m ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) 3 = n ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) 2
⇒ m ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) = n
⇒ m ( 26 / 25 ) = n
⇒ m / n = 25 / 26
Therefore , Rs . 5100 must be distribued in the ratio 25 : 26
So Mohan ' s share = 5100 × 25 / ( 25 + 26 ) = 2500
Answer B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's denote Mohan's share by x. Then, Sohan's share = 5100 - x.

The amount invested at 4% p.a. for 3 years at compound interest is given by A = P(26/23)3 = 1.404P.

Hence, x(1.404)3 = (5100 - x)(1.404)3

⇒ x = 2500.

So, the answer is (B).

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver , what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum ?['A ) 36 grams', 'B ) 40 grams', 'C ) 42 grams', 'D ) 48 grams', 'E ) 50 grams']
***********************************
ANSWER: Coin is basically a cylinder .
So volume of coin T = pi r ^ 2 h = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 * 2
Coin = Silver + Aluminum
Now total volume of coin ( T ) = volume of silver + volume of aluminum
Also , volume of silver ( Vs ) = volume of aluminum ( Va )
T = Va + Vb
T = 2 Va
Va = T / 2 = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 * 2 / 2 = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2
Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum .
Let the weight of aluminum in coin be x
Weight of Silver = 2 x
Total weight of coin = 30
x + 2 x = 30
x = 10
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10 gm
Wright of Silver in coin is 20 gm .
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10 gm and volume is pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2
Now new Aluminum coin is made with dimension 1 x 30 mm .
Volume of this new coin = pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 .
Volume of pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 contains weight of 10 gm of aluminum
Volume of pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 will contain = 10 / pi ( 7.5 ) ^ * pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 = 40 gm
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's solve this step-by-step.

1. The volume of the coin is 2 * 15 * 2 = 60 mm^3.
2. The volume of aluminum in the alloy is 60 / 2 = 30 mm^3.
3. The weight of aluminum in the alloy is 30 * 2 = 60 grams.
4. The weight of silver in the alloy is 30 grams.
5. The weight of a coin made of pure aluminum is 60 grams.
6. The answer is (A).

***********************************
ANSWER: Any quadratic equation will have real and distinct roots if the discriminant D > 0
The discriminant ' D ' of a quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 is given by b 2 - 4 ac
In this question , the value of D = 52 - 4 * 1 * k
If D > 0 , then 25 > 4 k or k < 6.2 .
Therefore , the highest integral value that k can take is 3 .
correct choice is ( C )
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The quadratic equation is x^2 - 5x + k = 0

For two real and distinct roots, the discriminant (b^2 - 4ac) > 0

ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

        The answer is (A).

        Let's look at the steps involved in solving this question.

        First, we need to find the total distance traveled by Shweta in 100 km, including the distance she travels to reach the rest stops. This is 100 km + 100 km / 15 km / rest stop * 10 rest stops = 130 km.

        Then, we need to divide this total distance by Shweta's speed to find the number of hours it takes her to travel 100 km. This is 130 km / 10 km / hour = 13 hours.

        Therefore, the answer is (A).

QUESTION: Mr . Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to a certain city and return by car . He loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train . How long would he have taken if he had traveled by car in both ways ?['A ) 22 hrs', 'B ) 18 hrs', 'C ) 16 hrs', 'D ) 20 hrs', 'E ) 13 hrs']
***********************************
ANSWER: Going one way by train and one way by car , he takes 17 hours .
Going both ways by train , he takes 4 hours more = > The train takes 4 hours more one way
Therefore travelling both ways by car , he takes 4 hours less than 17
= > He takes 17 - 4 = 13 hours .
E )
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

We know that the total distance covered by Mr. Sam is same whether he travels by train or by car.

Let the distance between the city and Mr. Sam's house be d.

Time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city = 17 hours

Time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car to the city = x hours

Time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by train to return from the city = 17 hours

Time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car to return from the city = y hours

We know that the total distance covered by Mr. Sam is same whether he travels by train or by car.

So, d = 17x + 17y

We also know that Mr. Sam loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.

So, 17 + 17 = 17x + 17y - 4

17x + 17y = 21

Substituting the value of 17x + 17y in d = 17x + 17y, we get

d = 21

Time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car to the city = x = d/2 = 21/2 = 10.5 hours

Time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car to return from the city = y = d/2 = 21/2 = 10.5 hours

Total time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways = 10.5 + 10.5 = 21 hours.

So the answer is (A).

***********************************
ANSWER: The amount remaining after each feeding session is 2 / 3 of what was in the bowl .
There were four feeding sessions .
The amount remaining just before noon was ( 2 / 3 ) ^ 4 = 16 / 81 , which is about 20 % .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

At 8 am, the dog ate 1 / 3 of the food in the bowl. So at 9 am, 2 / 3 of the original food was left. At 10 am, 1 / 3 of the food left at 9 am was eaten, so 1 / 3 * 2 / 3 = 2 / 9 of the original food was left. At 11 am, 1 / 3 of the food left at 10 am was eaten, so 1 / 3 * 2 / 9 = 2 / 27 of the original food was left. At noon, 1 / 3 of the food left at 11 am was eaten, so 1 / 3 * 2 / 27 = 2 / 81 of the original food was left. Therefore, 2 / 81 * 100% = 25% of the original food was left in the dog's bowl at noon.

The answer is (B).

If 10 men liked green cars more than red , how many people took the survey ?['A ) 100', 'B ) 120', 'C ) 50', 'D ) 200', 'E ) 80']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let N be the number of people who took the survey . The number of men M is given by M = N - 60 % N .
The number of men G who liked green cars more than red cars is given by
G = M - 25 % M
Given that G = 10 , solve for N
40 = ( N - 60 % N ) - 25 % ( N - 60 % N )
N = 100
Correct answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Let's think step-by-step.
Let the total number of people who took the survey be x.
60% of the people who took the survey were women, so 60 / 100 * x = 0.6x women took the survey.
100% - 60% = 40% of the people who took the survey were men.
75% of the men who took the survey preferred red cars over green cars, so 75 / 100 * 40 / 100 * x = 0.3x men preferred red cars over green cars.
10 men preferred green cars over red, so 0.3x - 10 = 0.3x - 10.
10 = 0.3x.
x = 10 / 0.3 = 33.33333333333333.
Rounded to the nearest integer, 33.33333333333333 = 33.
Thus, the answer is (C).

ANSWER: Let p = proportion that passed . Then 83 p + 55 ( 1 - p ) = 76 , so p = 21 / 28 = 75
correct answer E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Let's solve the 4th question:

On a test the passing students had an average of 83 , while the failing students had an average
of 55 . If the overall class average was 76 , what percent of the class passed ?

Let's say that the number of passing students was x and the number of failing students was y. We know that x + y = 100%. We also know that x(83) + y(55) = 100(76). Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get x(83) + y(55) = 100(76) = 100x + 55y = 7600. Subtracting 55y from both sides, we get 100x = 7600 - 55y. Dividing both sides by 100, we get x = 76 - 5.5y. Substituting this value of x into the first equation, we get 76 - 5.5y + y = 100%. Subtracting y from both sides, we get 76 - 4.5y = 100%. Dividing both sides by 4.5, we get 17 - y = 22.22%. Adding y to both sides, we get 17 = 22.22% + y. Subtracting 22.22% from both sides, we get y = 17 - 22.22% = 77.78%. Therefore, the percentage of students who passed the test is 100% - 77.78% = 22.22%.

The answer is: A ) 44 %

If there are 45 different ways that two balls can be selected from the box such that the ball with number 3 marked on it is not selected , then what is the value of n ?['A ) 11', 'B ) 10', 'C ) 9', 'D ) 8', 'E ) 7']
***********************************
ANSWER: ( n - 1 ) C 2 = 45
n - 1 = 10
n = 11
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The answer is (A).

        Let's think step-by-step.

        The number of ways of selecting two balls from a box containing n balls is nC2. So, nC2 = 45.

        We can also write nC2 = n(n-1)/2.

        Substituting nC2 = 45 in the above equation, we get n(n-1)/2 = 45.

        Multiplying both sides by 2, we get n(n-1) = 90.

        Expanding the brackets, we get n^2 - n = 90.

        Adding n to both sides, we get n^2 = 90 + n.

        Taking the square root of both sides, we get n = √(90+n).

        Since n is a positive integer, we can ignore the negative root.

        So, n = √(90+n) = √90 + √n.

        Squaring both sides, we get n^2 = 90 + n + 2√(n*90).

        Substituting n^2 = 90+n in the above equation, we get 90 + n + 2√(n*90) = 90 + n.

        Combining like terms, we get 2√(n*90) = 0.

        Since √(n*90) cannot be zero, we get n = 0.

        This is not possible, since n is a positive integer.

        So, we can conclude that n = 11.

QUESTION: If Q , a positive integer , has 5 factors , which of the following must be true about Q ?
I . Q is the square of a prime number .
II . Q is the fourth power of a prime number .
III . Q is the product of two prime numbers .['A ) I only', 'B ) III only', 'C ) II only', 'D ) I and II only', 'E ) I and III only']
***********************************
ANSWER: If Q has 5 factors , we can represent Q = a ^ 4 , where a is positive integer more than 1 . Let ' s assume that ` ` a ' ' is not a prime number . Let a = kp , where both k and p are positive integers .
Thus , Q = ( kp ) 4 = k 4 ∗ p 4 ( kp ) 4 = k 4 ∗ p 4 . Now the number of factors of Q = ( 4 + 1 ) * ( 4 + 1 ) = 25 . But as the given condition states that Q has ONLY 5 factors , thus ` ` a ' ' ca n ' t have any other factor except 1 and itself . Thus , a = prime number .
Statement I : We can represent Q = ( a ^ 2 ) ^ 2 . Thus , we have to prove whether a ^ 2 is a prime number . Take a = 2 . We can see that it is not a prime number . Thus , this option ca n ' t answer a ` ` MUST be true question ' '
Statement II : Always true as proved above .
Statement III : Again take a = 2 . Thus , Q = 64 . We do n ' t have this as product of 2 primes .
The Answer is , B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: "If Q has 5 factors , it must be the product of two prime numbers . The answer is (B)."

QUESTION: You can rent DVDs at a local video store for $ 4.00 per movie without a membership . However , if you purchase a membership for $ 7.00 per month , you can rent DVDs for $ 2.00 each . What is the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership ?['A ) 1', 'B ) 2', 'C ) 3', 'D ) 4', 'E ) 5']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let ' s compare the cost to rent x CDs .
4 x > 2 x + 7
2 x > 7
x > 3.5
The minimum number of CDs you would need to rent is 4 .
The answer is D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is D.

If you rent 1 DVD without a membership, you pay $4.00. If you rent 1 DVD with a membership, you pay $2.00. So the difference is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00. If you rent 2 DVDs without a membership, you pay $4.00 x 2 = $8.00. If you rent 2 DVDs with a membership, you pay $2.00 x 2 = $4.00. So the difference is $8.00 - $4.00 = $4.00. If you rent 3 DVDs without a membership, you pay $4.00 x 3 = $12.00. If you rent 3 DVDs with a membership, you pay $2.00 x 3 = $6.00. So the difference is $12.00 - $6.00 = $6.00. If you rent 4 DVDs without a membership, you pay $4.00 x 4 = $16.00. If you rent 4 DVDs with a membership, you pay $2.00 x 4 = $8.00. So the difference is $16.00 - $8.00 = $8.00. If you rent 5 DVDs without a membership, you pay $4.00 x 5 = $20.00. If you rent 5 DVDs with a membership, you pay $2.00 x 5 = $10.00. So the difference is $20.00 - $10.00 = $10.00.

So, the minimum amount of DVDs you would have to rent to make it worth it to purchase the membership is 4.

( Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different . )['A ) 120', 'B ) 19', 'C ) 180', 'D ) 420', 'E ) 460']
***********************************
ANSWER: No of ways = All ways to choose - ways using just men - ways using just women = C ( 8,4 ) - C ( 4,4 ) - C ( 4,4 ) = 21 - 1 - 1 = 19
Answer is ( B )
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

There are 4 men and 4 women so there are a total of 4 + 4 = 8 people in the team.

To form a group of 4 presenters, we have to choose 4 people from the team. The number of ways of choosing 4 people from 8 people is 8C4 = 8!/4!4! = 70.

But, we have to exclude the groups that are composed of men only or women only. So, we have to subtract 4C4 + 4C4 = 4 + 4 = 8 from the total number of ways.

Therefore, the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team is 70 - 8 = 62.

The answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: x = ( m / 100 ) * 4 y
m = 100 x / 4 y = 25 x / y
m is ( 2500 / y ) % of x .
The answer is D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let's solve this step-by-step.

        Given that x is m percent of 4y, we can write x = (m / 100) * 4y.

        We can then divide both sides of this equation by x to get (m / 100) * 4y / x = 4y / x.

        We can then multiply both sides of this equation by 100 to get 400y / x = 4y / x * 100.

        We can then simplify both sides of this equation to get 400y = 4x.

        We can then divide both sides of this equation by 4 to get 100y = x.

        This means that m is 100 percent of x.

        The answer is (C).

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The answer is (B).

        The probability that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election is 0.9. So the probability that a registered voter in Burghtown did not vote in the last election is 1 - 0.9 = 0.1.

        The probability that exactly four of five registered voters voted in the last election is:

        P(exactly four voted) = 5C4 * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^1 = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1 = 0.32825

        So the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election is 32.8%.

QUESTION: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced . If the yard has an area of 240 square meters , how many meters of fencing does she need ?['A ) 58', 'B ) 62', 'C ) 66', 'D ) 70', 'E ) 74']
***********************************
ANSWER: The sides of the rectangle have a length of 10 and L .
The area is 10 * L = 240 so L = 24 .
She needs fencing with a length of 10 + 2 * 24 = 58 meters .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the length and width of the yard be l and w respectively. Since the area of the yard is 240 square meters, l * w = 240. Since one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced, the length of the other three sides is 3l - 10. So the total length of fencing required is 3l - 10. Substituting l * w = 240 into 3l - 10, we get 3l - 10 = 3 * √(240) - 10. Solving for l, we get l = 10√3 + 5. Substituting l = 10√3 + 5 into 3l - 10, we get 3l - 10 = 3 * (10√3 + 5) - 10 = 30√3 + 15. So the total length of fencing required is 30√3 + 15 = 70 meters. The answer is (D).
