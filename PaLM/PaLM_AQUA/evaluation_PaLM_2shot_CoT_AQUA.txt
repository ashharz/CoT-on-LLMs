QUESTION: A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?['A ) 5 ( √ 3 + 1 )', 'B ) 6 ( √ 3 + √ 2 )', 'C ) 7 ( √ 3 – 1 )', 'D ) 8 ( √ 3 – 2 )', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h . Initially , he was at an angle of 450 . tan 45 = h / distance between car and tower . h = distance between car and tower ( since tan 45 = 1 ) .
Now , after 10 minutes , it travelled a certain distance , and angle changed to 600 .
tan 60 = h / x x = h / √ 3
So , in 10 minutes , it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h / √ 3 .
10 minutes = h * ( 1 – 1 √ 3 )
h can be travelled in 10 / ( 1 – 1 √ 3 ) .
To travel a distance of x , which is h / √ 3 , it takes :
h = 10 / ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 )
h / √ 3 = 10 / √ 3 * ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 ) . Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √ 3 ( conjugate of 1 - √ 3 ) . We get , x = h / √ 3 = 10 ( 1 + √ 3 ) / 2 = 5 * ( 1 + √ 3 )
So , it takes 5 ( 1 + √ 3 ) minutes to reach the base of the tower .
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let h be the height of the tower and d be the distance travelled by the car.

tan 45° = h/d = 1

tan 60° = h/(d + x) = √3

So, d + x = h√3

d = h(√3 - 1)

Time taken to travel d = d/s = h(√3 - 1)/s

Time taken to travel h√3 = h√3/s

∴ Required time = h√3/s - h(√3 - 1)/s = 5(√3 + 1)/s minutes.

The answer is (A).

QUESTION: The original price of an item is discounted 22 % . A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $ 20 - off coupon . There is no tax on the item , and this was the only item the customer bought . If the customer paid $ 1.90 more than half the original price of the item , what was the original price of the item ?['A ) $ 61', 'B ) $ 65', 'C ) $ 67.40', 'D ) $ 70', 'E ) $ 78.20']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let x be the original price of the item
Discounted price = 0.78 x
Payment made by the customer after using the $ 20 coupon = 0.78 x - 20
0.78 x - 20 = x / 2 + 1.9
x = 78.20
Answer : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: 

The original price of the item is x. The discounted price is x * 78 / 100 = 0.78x. The customer paid 0.78x - 20 = 0.58x. The customer paid 0.58x + 1.90 = 0.6x. So x = 0.6x / 0.58x = 67.40.

The answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: 450 * 12 ( x - 110 ) = 626400
where x is a selling cost of one item
x - 110 , is a profit from one item
450 - number of items produced and sold per month
12 - is a number of month in a year
Simplifying the equation will lead to x - 110 = 116 , then x = 230
B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The company produces 420 components per month, so the total number of components produced in a year is 420 * 12 = 5040. The company sells all of the components, so the total revenue from sales is 5040 * $240 = $121,040. The profit is the revenue from sales minus the production costs, so the profit is $121,040 - $626,400 = $-505,360. The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $240 + $505,360 / 5040 = $280.

**The answer is (E).**

***********************************
ANSWER: We ' re told that 10 % of staplers in a factory are defective .
X = Total staplers
0.1 X = defective staplers
0.9 X = normal staplers
Next , we ' re told that 2 % of the normal staplers were rejected by mistake and that this = 72 staplers .
0.9 X ( 0.02 ) = 72
0.018 X = 72
18 X = 72,000
X = 4,000
Final Answer :
A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's say the total number of staplers produced that day is x. Then, 10% of x = x/10 are defective. So, the number of non - defective staplers produced is x - x/10 = 9x/10. If 2% of the non - defective staplers were rejected, then 2% of 9x/10 = 9x/500 were rejected. So, 72 = 9x/500. This means x = 500 * 72 = 36,000. So, the answer is (E).

758
Therefore , the total number of ways of rearranging the 7 letter word = 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 7 ! Ways .
C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (C).

There are 7 letters in the word PROBLEC. We need to find the number of ways to arrange these letters such that none of the letters repeat.

We can do this by first finding the number of ways to arrange the letters in any order, and then subtracting the number of ways to arrange the letters such that some of the letters repeat.

The number of ways to arrange the letters in any order is 7!.

The number of ways to arrange the letters such that some of the letters repeat is 7P7 - 7P6 - 7P5 - 7P4 - 7P3 - 7P2 - 7P1.

7P7 = 7!

7P6 = 7!/6!

7P5 = 7!/5!

7P4 = 7!/4!

7P3 = 7!/3!

7P2 = 7!/2!

7P1 = 7!/1!

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word PROBLEC such that none of the letters repeat is 7! - 7!/6! - 7!/5! - 7!/4! - 7!/3! - 7!/2! - 7!/1! = 7! - 7!/6! - 7!/5! - 7!/4! - 7!/3! - 7!/2! - 7! = 7! - 7! - 7! - 7! - 7! - 7! - 7! = 0.

Therefore, the final answer is (C).

QUESTION: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys . Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy , and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy . During a month , both of them makes 35 toys in total . If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob ?['A ) 15', 'B ) 16', 'C ) 17', 'D ) 18', 'E ) 19']
***********************************
ANSWER: Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs . , and Jacob has worked for y hrs . So , number of toys prepared by Alex is x / 7 , and Jacob is y / 9 . Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35 .
= > x / 7 + y / 9 = 35 .
= > 9 x + 7 y = ( 35 ) ( 63 )
= > 7 y = ( 35 ) ( 63 ) - 9 x
= > y = ( 5 ) ( 63 ) - ( 9 / 7 ) x
= > y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) x
= > x is to be a multiple of 7 . Also , we need to minimize the difference between x & y . Here are some possible values ,
x = 126 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 126 = 153
x = 133 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 133 = 144
x = 140 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 140 = 135
x = 147 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs . and y is 135 hrs . Thus total toys created by Jacob = y / 9 = 135 / 9 = 15 .

Let the number of hours Alex and Jacob work be x and y respectively. We know that x + y = 35 hours. We also know that x / 7 = y / 9. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 9x / 7 = 35 hours. Multiplying both sides by 7, we get 9x = 245 hours. Dividing both sides by 9, we get x = 27 hours. Substituting this value of x into the equation y / 9 = x / 7, we get y = 24 hours. Therefore, Jacob has made 24 toys.

***********************************
ANSWER: Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50 % milk tea .
In step 1 , 15 % of the tea is replaced with milk . Thus , 85 % of the original tea remains . Since this is done twice , we have a concentration of 50 x 0.85 x 0.85 % ( = 36.125 % ) of tea solution .
Finally , 10 % of this solution is replaced with milk again . So , the final concentration of tea is 36.125 * 0.9 %
This equals 32.51 % of tea solution .
Answer : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

After replacing 15% of the tea with milk, the concentration of tea in the solution becomes 50 - 15 = 35%. Now, replacing 15% of the resultant solution with more milk again, the concentration of tea in the solution becomes 35 - 15 = 20%. Finally, replacing 10% of the resultant solution with more milk, the concentration of tea in the solution becomes 20 - 10 = 10%.

QUESTION: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48 cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides . Find the area of the sheet .['A ) 1584', 'B ) 1120', 'C ) 792', 'D ) 1320', 'E ) 1200']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let the sheet be folded along its breadth and its perimeter = 48 cm
Therefore , ( l / 2 + b ) = 48 . . . ( i )
Now , let the sheet be folded along its length , and the perimeter = 66 cm
( l + b / 2 ) = 66 … . . . ( ii )
Solving ( i ) and ( ii ) , we get ,
l = 56 cm , b = 20 cm
Area = l * b
Area = 1120 cm 2
ANSWER IS B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the length of the rectangle be l cm and breadth be b cm.

When folded along one set of sides, perimeter of each part = 2(l + b) = 48 cm

When folded along the other set of sides, perimeter of each part = 2(l + b) = 66 cm

Adding both the equations, we get 4l + 4b = 48 + 66 = 114

Dividing both sides by 2, we get l + b = 57

Squaring both sides, we get l^2 + b^2 = 3249

Area of the rectangle = l * b = √3249 = 57√2 cm^2

So, the answer is (B).

According to the Pythagoras theorem , sides 3 , 4 give diagonal as 5 = = > with 5 and 15 , we get 5 sqrt ( 10 ) .
5 sqrt ( 10 ) or 15.8113 is the diameter of the sphere .
answer = B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (D).

Let's first find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid. We can do this by using the Pythagorean theorem:

```
d = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2)
d = sqrt(9 + 16 + 225)
d = sqrt(240)
d = 16.0312
```

Now, we can use the fact that the diameter of the sphere is twice the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid to find the diameter of the sphere:

```
D = 2 * d
D = 2 * 16.0312
D = 32.0624
```

Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 32.0624.

QUESTION: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates , and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours . Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses , working together , then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours . How many hours would it have taken hose B , working alone , to fill the entire pool ?['A ) 8', 'B ) 15', 'C ) 12', 'D ) 6', 'E ) 3']
***********************************
ANSWER: Since hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours , then in 2 + 3 = 5 hours it will fill 5 / 8 th of the pool . Thus the remaining 3 / 8 th is filled by hose B in 3 hours . This means that hose B , working alone , to fill the entire pool will need 3 * 8 / 3 = 8 hours .
Answer : A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's say Hose B can fill the pool in x hours. So in 1 hour, Hose A can fill 1 / 8 of the pool and Hose B can fill 1 / x of the pool. In the first 2 hours, Hose A filled 2 * 1 / 8 = 1 / 4 of the pool. In the next 3 hours, Hose A and Hose B filled 3 * (1 / 8 + 1 / x) = 3 / 8 + 3 / x of the pool. Since the entire pool was filled, we have 1 / 4 + 3 / 8 + 3 / x = 1. Subtracting 1 / 4 from both sides, we get 3 / 8 + 3 / x = 3 / 4. Subtracting 3 / 8 from both sides, we get 3 / x = 3 / 4 - 3 / 8 = 3 / 8. Multiplying both sides by x, we get x = 3. So Hose B would have taken 3 hours to fill the entire pool.

The answer is (D).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let the number be x
10 x + 1 = 3 ( 100,000 + x )
= > x = 42857 .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Let the number be 10000x + y.
With a 1 before it, the number is 10001x + y.
With a 1 after it, the number is 10000x + 10000y + 10001.
Therefore, 10001x + y = 3(10000x + 10000y + 10001).
Simplifying, we get 10001x + y = 30001x + 30001y + 30003.
Subtracting 10001x + y from both sides, we get 20000x + 20000y = 30003.
Dividing both sides by 20000, we get x + y = 15.
Therefore, the number is 10000x + y = 10000(15) + 0 = 150000.
The answer is (D).

24 + 0.2 S = S - - > S = 30 .
Answer : B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the total number of students in Daifu university be x.

24% of x = members of both the chess club and the swim team

(100 - 24)% of x = members of the swim team but not of the chess club

20% of (100 - 24)% of x = members of the swim team but not of the chess club

20% of 76% of x = members of the swim team but not of the chess club

15.2% of x = members of the swim team but not of the chess club

15.2% of x + 24% of x = total members of the swim team

39.2% of x = total members of the swim team

39.2% = 392/1000

1000/392 = 2.54

254/100 = 25.4%

Therefore, the answer is (C).

QUESTION: A hollow cube of size 5 cm is taken , with the thickness of 1 cm . It is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm . If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted ?['A ) 438', 'B ) 550', 'C ) 500', 'D ) 450', 'E ) 498']
***********************************
ANSWER: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L 3 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 cm 3
Size of hollow cube ( considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3 cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 cm 3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm 3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 cm 3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes ( 6 faces each cube has ) = 98 * 6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6 * L 2 = 6 * 5 * 5 = 150 cm 2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1 * 1 = 1 cm 2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150 / 1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted = 588 - 150
= 438
answer . A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The answer is (D).

The outer surface of the cube has 6 faces, each of which is 5 cm * 5 cm = 25 cm^2. The inner surface of the cube has 6 faces, each of which is 4 cm * 4 cm = 16 cm^2. So the total area of the surface that is painted is 6 * 25 = 150 cm^2. The total area of the smaller cubes is 6 * 6 = 36 cm^2. So the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is 36 - 150 = 450.

QUESTION: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books . She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters . If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters , what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books ? ( Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter . )['A ) 3', 'B ) 4', 'C ) 5', 'D ) 10', 'E ) 20']
***********************************
ANSWER: The question asks for the smallest value of n , such that ( n + nC 2 ) = 10 ( n represents the number of letters . In this equation , n by itself is for single - letter codes and nC 2 is for two - letter codes ) .
At this point , you ' d need to pick numbers , since there ' s really no easy way to solve nC 2 = ( 10 – n ) without a calculator .
Looking at the answer choices , you can eliminate 10 and 20 , so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test . ( i . e . ( 10 – n ) suggests n can not be less than 10 . )
As a general rule , whenever you ' re asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition , start by testing the smallest number in the answers . Conversely , if you ' re asked for the largest value , start with the greatest answer .
Plug - in n = 4 to ( n + nC 2 ) = ( 4 + 4 C 2 ) = 4 + ( 4 x 3 / 2 ) = ( 4 + 6 ) = 10 ANS : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

If Amy uses a single letter to code each book, she will need 10 letters. If she uses a pair of letters to code each book, she will need 10 * 2 = 20 letters. Since 20 is greater than 10, the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 10.

***********************************
ANSWER: Let its breadth be = x m .
So length will be = ( 4 x + 1 ) m .
Now ,
x * ( 4 x + 1 ) = 150
or , 4 x ^ 2 + x - 150 = 0
or , ( 4 x + 25 ) ( x - 6 ) = 0
Either 4 x = - 25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4 * 6 + 1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2 * ( 25 + 6 ) = 62 mLet its breadth be = x m .
So length will be = ( 4 x + 1 ) m .
Now ,
x * ( 4 x + 1 ) = 150
or , 4 x ^ 2 + x - 150 = 0
or , ( 4 x + 25 ) ( x - 6 ) = 0
Either 4 x = - 25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4 * 6 + 1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2 * ( 25 + 6 ) = 62 m
ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be x m. Then, the length of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1) m. So, the area of the rectangular piece is (4x + 1)x = 150. This gives 4x2 + x - 150 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 10 m.

The perimeter of the rectangular piece is 2(x + 4x + 1) = 2(5x + 1) = 10x + 2 = 10(10) + 2 = 102 m.

So, the answer is (E).

Thus P = 3
Answer : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let's solve this step-by-step.

        Six pita breads = 2 rolls

        Three rolls = 5 baguettes

        Two baguettes = ?

        Let's set up a proportion:

        6 pita breads / 2 rolls = 2 baguettes / ?

        Cross-multiplying, we get:

        12 pita breads = 2 baguettes * 2 rolls

        Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

        6 pita breads = 2 baguettes * rolls

        Therefore, 2 baguettes = 6 pita breads / rolls.

        The answer is (D).

QUESTION: A straight picket fence is composed of x pickets each of which is 1 / 2 inch wide . If there are 6 inches of space between each pair of pickets , which of the following represents the length of fence in feet ?['A ) 13 x / 2', 'B ) 13 x / 2 - 6', 'C ) 13 x / 24', 'D ) ( 13 x + 1 ) / 24', 'E ) ( 13 x - 12 ) / 24']
***********************************
ANSWER: Number of pickets = x
Size of pickets = 1 / 2
length of pickets = 1 / 2 x
If there are x pickets , it implies that there are x - 1 spaces between the picket
Length of space = 6
total number of length = 1 / 2 x + 6 ( x - 1 ) in inches
total length in feet = ( 1 / 2 x + 6 ( x - 1 ) ) / 12
Simplify to get ( 13 X - 12 ) / 24
ANSWER : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

```
The length of the fence in inches is 1 / 2 * x + 6 * ( x - 1 ) = 13 x / 2 - 6. The length of the fence in feet is ( 13 x / 2 - 6 ) / 12 = ( 13 x - 12 ) / 24.

QUESTION: A ship went on a voyage . After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship . Find the distance when they meet from starting point .['A ) 238', 'B ) 289', 'C ) 200', 'D ) 287', 'E ) 187']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let the speed of the ship = m miles / hr . and plane took ' t ' hours to meet the ship
Then , m × t is the distance ship traveled after plane started
So we have , mt + 180 = 10 mt
⇒ 9 mt = 180
⇒ mt = 20
Hence distance = 180 + 20 = 200 miles
Answer : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the speed of the ship be s miles/hr. Then the speed of the plane is 10s miles/hr. The total distance traveled by the ship and the plane is 180 + 10s. The time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is 180/s hr. The time taken by the plane to travel 180 + 10s miles is (180 + 10s)/10s = 18 + 10/s hr. Since the ship and the plane meet at the same time, we have 180/s = 18 + 10/s. Solving for s, we get s = 36 miles/hr. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the ship and the plane is 180 + 10s = 180 + 10(36) = 286 miles.

QUESTION: In a large forest , 300 deer were caught , tagged , and returned during 2001 . During 2002 , 500 deer were caught at random , of which only 20 had tags from the previous year . If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags , what is the total deer population in the forest ( assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002 ) ?['A ) 300', 'B ) 500', 'C ) 5000', 'D ) 6000', 'E ) 7500']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let N = the total number of deer in the forest .
During the first year , the percent of deer in the entire population with tags was : 300 / N
20 / 500 is the percent of deer caught during the second year that had tags . Since this sample percent matches the percent for the entire population ( i . e . , the total number of tagged deer divided by the total number of deer ) , the two ratios are equal .
Equating these two percents :
Sample = Population
( 20 / 500 ) = ( 300 / N )
N = ( 300 / 1 ) * ( 500 / 20 )
N = 7500
Answer E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (E).

The number of deer with tags in the second year is 20 / 500 = 0.04. So the total deer population in the forest is 300 / 0.04 = 7500.

What is the probability of the man catching the first train ?['A ) 0.9', 'B ) 0.8', 'C ) 0.6', 'D ) 0.65', 'E ) 1.5']
***********************************
ANSWER: For each 10 min interval , if man comes in first 2 min , he ' ll catch the 1 st train , if he comes in next 8 min , he ' ll catch the 2 nd train .
Hence , for harbor line = ( 2 / 10 ) = 0.2 and for main line 0.8 .
Answer : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The answer is (C).

        The probability of the man catching the harbor line train is 8 / 10, because it starts at 5.02 and the man arrives at 5.

        The probability of the man catching the main line train is 2 / 10, because it starts at 5 and the man arrives at 5.

        So the total probability of the man catching the first train is 8 / 10 + 2 / 10 = 10 / 10 = 1.

        This is the same as 0.6.

QUESTION: Boomtown urban planners expect the city ’ s population to increase by 10 % per year over the next two years . If that projection were to come true , the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago . Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year ?['A ) 20 %', 'B ) 40 %', 'C ) 50 %', 'D ) 65 %', 'E ) 75 %']
***********************************
ANSWER: Population now - 100 ;
Population one year from now - 110 ;
Population two years from now - 121 ;
Since the population two years from now ( 121 ) is exactly double the population one year ago then the population one year ago was 121 / 2 = 60.5 .
Now , the question asks about the population increase over the last year , so from 60.5 ( last year ) to 100 ( now ) : percent increase = difference / original * 100 = ( 100 - 60.5 ) / 60.5 * 100 = 39.5 / 60.5 * 100 = ~ 2 / 3 * 100 = ~ 65 % .
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let P be the population of Boomtown one year ago. If the population increases by 10% per year, then the population two years from now will be P * 1.1 * 1.1 = 1.21P. Since the population two years from now is double the population of one year ago, we have 1.21P = 2P, which means P = 2 / 1.21 = 1.64. Therefore, the population of Boomtown increased by 1.64 - 1 = 0.64, or 64%, over the last year.

The answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Suppose Arun has $ X and Sajal has $ Y . then ,
2 ( x - 30 ) = y + 30 = > 2 x - y = 90 … ( i )
and x + 10 = 3 ( y - 10 ) = > x - 3 y = - 40 … ( ii )
Solving ( i ) and ( ii ) , we get x = 62 and y = 34 .
Arun has $ 62 and Sajal has $ 34 .
Answer B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the money with Arjun be x and the money with Sajal be y.

If Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, he will have (x - 30) and Sajal will have (y + 30).

Since Sajal will have twice the money left with Arjun, we have (y + 30) = 2(x - 30).

Or, y = 2x - 90.

If Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, he will have (x + 10) and Sajal will have (y - 10).

Since Arjun will have thrice as much as is left with Sajal, we have (x + 10) = 3(y - 10).

Or, x = 3y - 30.

Substituting the value of y from the first equation into the second equation, we have x = 3(2x - 90) - 30.

Or, x = 6x - 270 - 30.

Or, 5x = 240.

Or, x = 48.

Substituting the value of x into the first equation, we have y = 2(48) - 90 = 34.

Therefore, Arjun has $48 and Sajal has $34.

The answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let x be the length of one side of the original square .
The area of the rectangle is x ( x - 4 ) = 140 .
x = 14 .
The perimeter of the square was 4 * 14 = 56 feet .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the side of the square piece of cloth = x

Perimeter of the square piece of cloth = 4x

After trimming, the length of the rectangular piece = x - 4

Breadth of the rectangular piece = x

Area of the rectangular piece = (x - 4) * x = x^2 - 4x

After cutting diagonally, each triangle will have sides of length x - 2 and x - 2

Area of each triangle = (x - 2)^2 = x^2 - 4x + 4

Since the area of each triangle is 70 sq ft,

x^2 - 4x + 4 = 70

x^2 - 4x - 66 = 0

(x - 11)(x + 6) = 0

x = 11 or x = -6

Since length cannot be negative, x = 11 feet

Perimeter of the original square piece of cloth = 4 * 11 = 44 feet

The answer is (E).

QUESTION: M = abc is a three digit number and N = cba , if M > N and M - N + 396 c = 990 . Then how many values of M are more than 300 .['A ) 20', 'B ) 30', 'C ) 40', 'D ) 200', 'E ) None']
***********************************
ANSWER: From the given data ,
abc – cba + 396 c = 990
100 a + 10 b + c – ( 100 c + 10 b + a ) + 396 c = 990
99 a – 99 c + 396 c = 990
Observe that each term is divisible by 99 . So on dividing the above expression by 99 , we get
a – c + 4 c = 10
a + 3 c = 10
For c = 1 , a = 7
c = 2 , a = 4
c = 3 , a = 1
' b ' can take any value from 0 to 9
We have to find the value of M more than 300 . So minimum value of ' a ' should be 4 .
So total possibilities are 402 , 412 , . . . . , 492 = 10 values
701 , 711 , . . . . . , 791 = 10 values
So total values = 20 .
Correct option : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        
        M - N = 990 - 396c
        M = N + 990 - 396c
        M = 100c + 990
        Since M > 300 , 100c + 990 > 300
        100c > 990 - 300
        100c > 690
        c > 6.9
        c can take values from 7 to 9 .
        So the total number of values of M that are greater than 300 is 3 .
        The answer is (B).

ANSWER: 20 % means 1 / 5 and 28 % means 7 / 25 , taking the lcm of the denominators 5 and 25 we get 25 , the least multiple of 25 which is greater than 501 is 525 . So , answer is none
ANSWER : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the total number of students in the school be x.

Since 20% of the students took physics, the number of students who took physics is 20/100 * x = 2x/10.

Since 28% of the students took math, the number of students who took math is 28/100 * x = 7x/25.

Since 20% + 28% = 48% of the students took either physics or math, the number of students who took either physics or math is 48/100 * x = 9x/25.

Since x > 501, 9x/25 > 501, or x > 25 * 501/9 = 1255.

Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 1255.

The answer is (E).

In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs . 2040 . In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays . The bill for that month would be :['A ) Rs . 1560', 'B ) Rs . 1680', 'C ) Rs . 1840', 'D ) Rs . 1950', 'E ) Rs . 1690']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let the fixed amount be Rs . X and the cost of each unit be Rs . Y .
Then , 540 y + x = 1800 … . And 620 y + x = 2040
On subtracting ( i ) from ( ii ) , we get 80 y = 240 - > y = 3
Putting y = 3 in ( i ) we get :
540 * 3 + x = 1800 x = ( 1800 - 1620 ) = 180
. : Fixed charges = Rs . 180 , Charge per unit = Rs . 3 .
Total charges for consuming 500 units = 180 + ( 500 * 3 ) = Rs . 1680
Answer : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let the fixed charge be Rs. x. Then, 540x + 1800 = 620x + 2040
⇒ 80x = 240
⇒ x = 3
∴ The bill for 500 calls = 500x + 1800 = 1560.
Thus, the answer is (A).

QUESTION: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track . Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes . Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes . If they start rotating now from the same point , when will they be at the same starting point again ?['A ) 1 hour and 31 minutes', 'B ) 2 hour and 31 minutes', 'C ) 3 hour and 31 minutes', 'D ) 4 hour and 31 minutes', 'E ) 5 hour and 31 minutes']
***********************************
ANSWER: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes , it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes . If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes , it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes .
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points . Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations . Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T . Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point . Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13 . The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13 . Hence
X = 7 ( 13 ) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes
correct answer A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The time taken by A to make one full rotation = 26/2 = 13 minutes
The time taken by B to make one full rotation = 35/5 = 7 minutes
The LCM of 13 and 7 = 91
So, they will be at the same starting point after 91 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is (E).

96 / x - 4 - 96 / x = 4 = > x = 12
So , required number = x - 4 = 8 .
Answer is A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Initial number of friends = x
Initial expenditure = Rs. 96
Number of friends who did not turn up = 4
Remaining number of friends = x - 4
Expenditure per head = 96 / (x - 4)
Extra expenditure per head = 4
Total expenditure = 96 / (x - 4) + 4
96 / (x - 4) + 4 = 96
96 / (x - 4) = 92
x - 4 = 12
x = 16

So, the answer is (C).

But she said , ` ` I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight . ` ` How much does Meenu weigh ?['A ) 12', 'B ) 28', 'C ) 27', 'D ) 58', 'E ) 91']
***********************************
ANSWER: It is given that Meenu weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her own weight .
It means that 29 Kgs is the other half . So she weighs 58 Kgs .
Solving mathematically , let ' s assume that her weight is A Kgs .
A = 29 + A / 2
2 × A = 58 + A
A = 58 Kgs .
Answer : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Meenu 's weight = 29 + (29 / 2 ) = 29 + 14.5 = 43.5 kgs

Explanation:
Let Meenu 's weight be 'x' kgs
Silu 's weight = 51 kgs
Meenu said , ` ` I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight . ` `
29 + ( x / 2 ) = 51
( x / 2 ) = 51 - 29 = 22
x = 22 * 2 = 44 kgs
Meenu 's weight = 44 kgs

However , Meenu said she is overweight .
So her actual weight = 44 + 5 = 49 kgs

Therefore , the answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let , n be the number of members in the club . Then ,
250 = ( n x [ 2 × 7 + ( n + 1 ) × 3 / 12 ] ) / 2 .
n = 25 .
Hence , the number of members in the club is 25 .
Answer : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Let the total number of members in the club be n.

The ages of the members in the club are 7, 7 + 3, 7 + 3 * 2, ..., 7 + 3(n - 1).

The sum of the ages of the members in the club = n * (7 + 3(n - 1))/2 = 250.

7n + 3n(n - 1) = 500.

7n + 3n^2 - 3n = 500.

3n^2 - 4n - 500 = 0.

(3n + 25)(n - 20) = 0.

n = 20 or n = -25.

Since n cannot be negative, n = 20.

The number of members in the club = 20.

The answer is (B).

***********************************
ANSWER: Distance covered by train A before the train B leaves
Mumbai Central = 40 × 3 = 120 km
Time taken to cross each other = 120 ⁄ 12 = 10 hours
Required time = 2 pm + 10 = 12 am on the next day
Answer A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (D).

Let's solve step-by-step.

The distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is d = 720 km. The time taken by train A to cover this distance is t1 = d/s1 = 720/40 = 18 hours. The time taken by train B to cover this distance is t2 = d/s2 = 720/72 = 10 hours. The time at which the two trains meet is t = t1 + t2 = 18 + 10 = 28 hours. So the two trains will meet at 2 pm on the next day.

QUESTION: x men working x hours per day can do x units of a work in x days . How much work can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days ?['A ) x 2 / y 2 units', 'B ) y 3 / x 2 units', 'C ) x 3 / y 2 units', 'D ) y 2 / x 2 units', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Amount of work completed by 1 man in 1 day , working 1 hours a day = x / x 3 = 1 / x 2
Amount of work y men in y days , working y hours a day = y 3 × ( 1 / x 2 ) = y 3 / x 2 . Answer : Option B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        
        The answer is (C).

        The formula for work done is:

        ```
        Work = (Number of men) * (Number of hours per day) * (Number of days)
        ```

        In the question, we are given that x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days. We can substitute these values into the formula to get:

        ```
        x units = (x men) * (x hours per day) * (x days)
        ```

        Dividing both sides by x^3, we get:

        ```
        \frac{x units}{x^3} = \frac{(x men) * (x hours per day) * (x days)}{x^3}
        ```

        Rearranging, we get:

        ```
        \frac{x units}{x^3} = \frac{(x men)}{x} * \frac{(x hours per day)}{x} * \frac{(x days)}{x}
        ```

        Since x men working x hours per day for x days can do x units of work, then y men working y hours per day for y days can do:

        ```
        \frac{x units}{x^3} * \frac{y^3}{y^3} * \frac{y^3}{y^3} = \frac{x^3}{y^3} units
        ```

        Therefore, y men working y hours per day for y days can complete x^3 / y^3 units of work.

Winter + Summer - Both + Neither = 100
75 + Summer - 40 + 20 = 100
Summer = 45
Summer but not winter Q = Summer only = Summer - Both ( i . e . summer overlap with winter ) = 45 - 40 = 5
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

75% of employees take a winter vacation, 40% take both winter and summer vacation, and 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. Therefore, 75% - 40% = 35% of employees take only a winter vacation. Since 20% of employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then 100% - 20% = 80% of employees take either a winter or a summer vacation. Therefore, 80% - 35% = 45% of employees take only a summer vacation.

d = 80
Answer : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's solve this step-by-step.

1. We know that the area of a trapezium is given by:

```
A = (a + b) * h / 2
```

where `a` and `b` are the lengths of the parallel sides and `h` is the height of the trapezium.

2. In this case, we have `a = 10`, `b = 6`, and `A = 640`. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

```
640 = (10 + 6) * h / 2
```

3. Simplifying, we get:

```
h = 80
```

4. Therefore, the depth of the canal is 80 meters.

The answer is (D).

***********************************
ANSWER: Knowing that the team lost 30 % of their matches , it has won 70 % of their matches
Total matches = 20 / ( 70 / 100 ) = 14
Hence number of matches that the team lost = 20 x 14 / 100 = 3 = C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the total number of matches played by the team = x

Number of matches won = 20

Number of matches lost = x - 20

30/100 * x = x - 20

3x/10 = x - 20

3x = 10x - 200

7x = 200

x = 200/7 = 28.57

Number of matches lost = 28.57 - 20 = 8.57

Rounded off to the nearest whole number, the number of matches lost is 8.

The answer is (C).

MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (B).

The distance traveled by the point is the circumference of the circle traced by the point, which is 2πr = 2π * 10 = 20π cm. The number of revolutions per minute is 300, so the number of revolutions per second is 300 / 60 = 5. So the point travels 5 * 20π = 1000π cm in 30 seconds.

i . e which is least value for n = 28 .
Answer : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

```
Step-by-step explanation:

Let's first find the minimum and maximum values of n.

36 ≤ n ≤ 72

√36 ≤ √n ≤ √72

6 ≤ √n ≤ 8

Now, let's find the minimum and maximum values of x.

x = ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( n + 4 √ n + 4 )

= ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( n + 4 √ n + 4 )

= ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 6 + 4 √ 6 + 4 )

= ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 10 + 4 √ 6 )

= ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 10 + 4(2.449489742 ))

= ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 10 + 9.798 )

= ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 19.798 )

Minimum value of x = ( 36 2 + 2 √ 36 ( 36 + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 36 + 4 √ 36 + 4 )

= ( 1296 + 240 + 16 ) / ( 48 + 144 + 4 )

= 1456 / 200

= 7.28

Maximum value of x = ( 72 2 + 2 √ 72 ( 72 + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 72 + 4 √ 72 + 4 )

= ( 5184 + 672 + 16 ) / ( 80 + 288 + 4 )

= 6000 / 372

= 16.11

Therefore, the answer is '23 < x < 58'.

QUESTION: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17 , and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109 . If we subtract 495 from the number , we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order . Find the number .['A ) 368', 'B ) 377', 'C ) 288', 'D ) 997', 'E ) 112']
***********************************
ANSWER: Sum of the squares should be equal to 109 . Only Options B and D satisfying . When we subtract 495 , only 863 becomes 368
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the number be 100*x + 10*y + z.

Given that x + y + z = 17 and x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109.

We can write the number as 100*x + 10*(y - 7) + z - 495

The number after reversing the digits is 100*z + 10*(y - 7) + x - 495.

Therefore, 100*x + 10*(y - 7) + z - 495 = 100*z + 10*(y - 7) + x - 495

Or, x = z.

Substituting this in the equation x + y + z = 17, we get 2x + y = 17.

Substituting x = z in the equation x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109, we get 2z^2 + y^2 = 109.

Substituting 2x + y = 17 in this equation, we get 2z^2 + (17 - 2z)^2 = 109.

Or, 4z^2 - 54z + 289 = 109.

Or, 4z^2 - 54z + 180 = 0.

Or, (2z - 15)(2z - 12) = 0.

Therefore, z = 15 or z = 12.

Since x = z, x = 15 or x = 12.

Therefore, the number is either 150*15 + 10*(15 - 7) + 15 - 495 = 368 or 150*12 + 10*(12 - 7) + 12 - 495 = 288.

So, the answer is (C).

40 grams of mixture 1 contains 6 * 40 / 15 = 16 grams of zinc and 24 grams of copper
60 grams of mixture 2 contains 7 * 60 / 18 = 77 / 3 grams of zinc and 110 / 3 grams of copper
Thus , ratio = ( 16 + 77 / 3 ) / ( 24 + 110 / 3 ) = 59 / 91
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The total amount of zinc in alloy X is 40 * 6/15 = 16 grams. The total amount of copper in alloy X is 40 * 9/15 = 24 grams. The total amount of zinc in alloy Y is 60 * 7/18 = 25 grams. The total amount of copper in alloy Y is 60 * 11/18 = 45 grams. The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 25 = 41 grams. The total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 45 = 69 grams. The ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z is 41 : 69 = 59 : 91.

‹ = › Solving x + y = 1000 and x - y = 256 ,
‹ = › we get : x = 628 and y = 372 .
Answer B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the two numbers be x and y. Then, x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and x + y = 1000.

        Adding 2xy to both sides, we get x^2 + y^2 + 2xy = 256000 + 2xy = 256000 + 1000 * 1000 = 3600000.

        Therefore, (x + y)^2 = 3600000.

        Since (x + y)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + 2xy, we get x^2 + y^2 = 3600000 - 2xy.

        Substituting the value of x^2 - y^2 = 256000 from the first equation into the second equation, we get 256000 + 2xy = 3600000 - 2xy.

        Simplifying, we get 4xy = 1040000.

        Dividing both sides by 4, we get xy = 260000.

        Taking square roots of both sides, we get x = 600 and y = 400.

        Therefore, the two numbers are 600 and 400.

        The answer is (A).

How much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other ?['A ) 3 hours', 'B ) 5 hours', 'C ) 6 hours', 'D ) 4 hours', 'E ) 7 hours']
***********************************
ANSWER: Relative Speed : 55 - 52 = 3 mph
Distance : 15 miles
Time : distance / speed = 15 / 3 = 5 hours
Correct answer is B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The first car travels 55 miles per hour, so in 1 hour it will travel 55 miles. The second car travels 52 miles per hour, so in 1 hour it will travel 52 miles. In 1 hour, the distance between the two cars will be 55 miles - 52 miles = 3 miles. Since the cars are travelling in the same direction, the distance between them will not increase over time. Therefore, it will take 3 hours for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other. The answer is (A).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let x be the probability that B does not occur .
P ( A and B do not occur ) = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04
0.4 x = 0.04
x = 0.1
P ( B occurs ) = 1 - x = 0.9
The answer is E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

1. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
2. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).
3. Substituting (1) into (2), we get P(A or B) = P(A) * P(B) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) = P(B) + P(A) * (1 - P(B)).
4. We are given that P(A or B) = 0.96 and P(A) = 0.6. Substituting these values into (3), we get 0.96 = P(B) + 0.6 * (1 - P(B)).
5. Subtracting 0.6 from both sides, we get 0.36 = 0.6 * (1 - P(B)).
6. Dividing both sides by 0.6, we get 0.6 = 1 - P(B).
7. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get P(B) = 0.4.

So the answer is 'C'.

speed of M = x / 4
speed of N = 2 x / 7
Distance covered by M in y + 2 hrs + Distance covered by N in
y hrs is x
x / 4 ( y + 2 ) + 2 x / 7 ( y ) = x
y = 14 / 15 hr or 56 min
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The distance between City A and City B is d = speed * time = 54 kmph * 4 hours = 216 km. The relative speed of the two trains is 54 + 54 = 108 kmph. The time taken by the two trains to cross each other is t = d / speed = 216 km / 108 kmph = 2 hours. So the two trains cross each other at 5 + 2 = 7 am.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Let's first find the distance between City A and City B. We know that the speed of train M is 54 kmph and it takes 4 hours to reach City B. So the distance between City A and City B is d = speed * time = 54 kmph * 4 hours = 216 km.
2. Next, we need to find the relative speed of the two trains. We know that the speed of train N is 54 kmph and it takes 3.5 hours to reach City A. So the relative speed of the two trains is 54 + 54 = 108 kmph.
3. Now that we know the distance between the two cities and the relative speed of the two trains, we can find the time it takes for the two trains to cross each other. We know that t = d / speed = 216 km / 108 kmph = 2 hours. So the two trains cross each other at 5 + 2 = 7 am.

Length of paper = ( 260 / 2 ) m = 130 m .
Therefore , area of paper = ( 130 * 50 / 100 ) = 65 m 2
Area of 4 walls = ( 65 + 15 ) = 80 m 2
2 ( length + breadth ) * height = 80 .
Therefore , 2 * 5 x * 2 x = 80 or x 2 = 4 or x = 2
Therefore , height of the room = 4 m

 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let the length and breadth of the room be l and b.

2h/(l+b) = 2/5

2h = 2(l+b)/5

h = (2l+2b)/5

Area of the 4 walls = 2h(l+b)

2h(l+b) = 260 + 15 = 275

(2l+2b) = 275/2 = 137.5

l+b = 137.5/2 = 68.75

h = (2l+2b)/5 = 137.5/10 = 13.75 = 14 m

= > m = - 16.2
ANSWER : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's solve this step-by-step.

1. We know that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation is -b / a. So, in this case, 1.5 + x = -m / 1.

2. We also know that the product of the roots of a quadratic equation is c / a. So, 1.5 * x = 22 / 1.

3. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get 1.5 + 22 / 1 = -m / 1.

4. Multiplying both sides of the equation by 1, we get 1.5 + 22 = -m.

5. Subtracting 22 from both sides of the equation, we get -10.5 = -m.

6. Finally, multiplying both sides of the equation by -1, we get m = 10.5.

Therefore, the answer is C).

So, the total cost of 5 articles after the price decrease is $5x * (85 / 100)x = $425 / 100x = $300. So, $x = $300 * (100 / 425) = $8.

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $8.

The answer is (A).

QUESTION: 10 kg of a mixture contains 30 % sand and 70 % clay . In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand ?['A ) 10 / 7', 'B ) 20 / 7', 'C ) 30 / 7', 'D ) 40 / 7', 'E ) 50 / 7']
***********************************
ANSWER: The mixture contains 3 kg sand and 7 kg clay .
For the mixture to be in equal quantities , there should be 2 kg of clay removed .
Clay and sand are in the ratio 7 : 3
So part of sand to be removed = 2 * 3 / 7 = 6 / 7
So total mixture to be removed = 2 + 6 / 7 = 20 / 7
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

10 kg of mixture contains 30% sand = 10 * 30 / 100 = 3 kg
10 kg of mixture contains 70% clay = 10 * 70 / 100 = 7 kg
If we want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to remove 3 kg of clay and replace it with 3 kg of sand.

Therefore, the amount of mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand = 3 + 3 = 6 kg.

The amount of mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand = 6 / 10 = 60 / 100 = 60 / 100 * 7 = 42 / 7 kg.

Therefore, the answer is 42 / 7.

***********************************
ANSWER: Let Rs 100 be the income
Expenditure = Rs 70
Increased income = Rs 120
Expenditure in amount is same .
So , expenditure % = 70 / 120 * 100 = 58.3 %
ANSWER : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let the man's income be Rs. 100. So, his expenditure = 70% of 100 = Rs. 70. If his income increases by 20%, his new income = 100 + 20 = 120. So, his new expenditure = 70% of 120 = Rs. 84.

Therefore, the new expenditure is 84/120 * 100 = 68.3% of his new income.

The answer: **A)**

***********************************
ANSWER: Let ’ s go through each answer choice : ( A ) can never be true , since no negative is greater than a positive . ( B ) doesn ’ t have to be true – consider what would happen if x = - 2 and y = 1 . ( C ) can never be true , as x ^ 3 must be negative , and y ^ 2 must be positive . ( D ) can never be true , since if x < 0 , - x is the same thing as | x | , and | x | > y . ( E ) can be manipulated by multiplying both sides by - 1 , which gives us – x > y . Remember that x < 0 , so – x = | x | , and y is positive , so | y | = y . Thus – x ^ 3 > y ^ 2 is the same statement as | x ^ 3 | > | y ^ 2 | , and ( B ) must be true .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Since x < 0 and y > 0, then -x > y. Also, | x ^ 3 | = x ^ 3 and | y ^ 2 | = y ^ 2. Therefore, -x ^ 3 < y ^ 2.

QUESTION: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each . What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased ?['A ) 9 Trousers', 'B ) 8 Trousers', 'C ) 10 Trousers', 'D ) 7 Trousers', 'E ) 11 Trousers']
***********************************
ANSWER: Lets assume S as price of shirt and T as price of trousers , we have bellow equation :
70 T + 30 S = 810
Simplifying we get : 7 T + 3 S = 81
T = ( 81 - 3 * S ) / 7
We need to find the least value of S which will make ( 81 - 3 * S ) divisible by 7
Simplifying by taking 3 as common factor 3 * ( 27 - S ) / 7
Looking at the above equation its not difficult to find out least value of S is 6 so that 27 - 3 S becomes divisible by S
Hence , T = ( 81 - 3 * S ) / 7 = ( 81 - 3 * 6 ) / 7 = 63 / 7 = 9
ANSWER : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's say the man bought x trouser and y shirt. So, 70x + 30y = 810.

Let's assume the man bought the maximum number of trouser, i.e., x = 11. Substituting this value in the equation, we get 70(11) + 30y = 810.

Solving this equation, we get y = 9.

So, the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased is 11:9.

After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount .
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?['A ) 10', 'B ) 23', 'C ) 16', 'D ) 18', 'E ) 12']
***********************************
ANSWER: The amount won and lost by both is equal .
Thus 2 x = 3 ( 20 - x ) - - - x in the number of times heads came
X = 12
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's think step-by-step.

Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads 10 times and on Tails 10 times. So, Christopher gave 10 * $2 = $20 to Jonathan and Jonathan gave 10 * $3 = $30 to Christopher. So, Christopher lost $20 - $30 = $10. And Jonathan lost $30 - $20 = $10. So, Christopher and Jonathan both lost $10. But the question states that Christopher and Jonathan won or lost no amount. So, the coin landed on Heads 10 times and on Tails 10 times cannot be true.

So, the coin landed on Heads 12 times and on Tails 8 times. So, Christopher gave 12 * $2 = $24 to Jonathan and Jonathan gave 8 * $3 = $24 to Christopher. So, Christopher and Jonathan both won $24. So, the coin landed on Heads 12 times and on Tails 8 times is true.

By the time they meet for the second time , Bob covers 48 km more than Allen . Find the distance between X and Y .['A ) 144 km', 'B ) 72 km', 'C ) 126 km', 'D ) 84 km', 'E ) 48 km']
***********************************
ANSWER: Total distance 126 km
in an hour both Allen and Bob covered 126 km
that is 54 + 78 = 132
they meet for the first time Bob covered more KM than Allen . 78 - 54 = 24 .
so when they meet for the second time Bob covered 24 * 2 = 48 more km ( ANSWER E )
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the distance between X and Y be d.

Time taken by Allen to travel from X to Y = d/54
Time taken by Bob to travel from Y to X = d/78
Time taken by Allen to travel from Y to X = d/54
Time taken by Bob to travel from X to Y = d/78

Total time taken by both of them to meet for the second time = d/54 + d/78 + d/54 + d/78 = 2d/54 + 2d/78 = 3d/36 = d/12

Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, the total distance covered by both of them = 48 + d = d/12 * 12 = 12d

So, the distance between X and Y = d = 12d/12 = 12 km.

***********************************
ANSWER: Average cost of new tire = $ 45 / tire
cost of repairing the current tire = $ 40 / tire
new tire is $ 5 more per tire .
i e . 5 / 40 = 1 / 8 = 12.5 %
ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The answer is (D).

The new tires will last for 4 + 1 = 5 years. So the average cost per year of the new tires is 180 / 5 = $36. The current tires will last for 4 - 1 = 3 years. So the average cost per year of repairing the current tires is 40 / 3 = $13.33. The difference is 36 - 13.33 = $22.67. So the average cost per year of the new tires is 22.67 / 13.33 = 1.67 times greater than the cost of repairing the current tires. This is 16.7 % greater.

***********************************
ANSWER: Length of the rope = 20 meters .
Assume length of longer piece = x meters .
Length of shorter piece = x - 3
We know that x + x - 3 = 20
2 x = 23
Length of the longer piece = x = 11.5 meters
Correct Option : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. So, x + (x - 3) = 20. Combining like terms, we get 2x - 3 = 20. Adding 3 to both sides, we get 2x = 23. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 11.5. Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. The answer is (D).

***********************************
ANSWER: A ' s one minute work = 1 / 40
B ' s one minute work = 1 / 45
( A + B ) ' s one minute work = 1 / 40 + 1 / 45 = 85 / 40 * 45 = 17 / 360
so , ( A + B ) will do work together in 360 / 17 min = 21 3 / 17 minutes
21 min approximately
ANSWER : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

A's 1 hour work = 1/40
B's 1 hour work = 1/45

QUESTION: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $ 20 000 with terms 4 / 30 , n / 100 . What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount ?['A ) 247.67', 'B ) 237.67', 'C ) 227.67', 'D ) 215.67', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Explanation :
Suppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4 % of $ 20 000 = $ 800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice . He needs to borrow $ 20 000 = $ 800 = $ 19 200 . He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 ( the day the original invoice is due ) resulting in a 70 - day loan . The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $ 800 .
r = I / pt = 21.73 %
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73 % . This is a break - even rate . If he can borrow money , say at a rate of 15 % , he should do so . He would borrow $ 19 200 for 70 days at 15 % . Maturity value of the loan is $ 19 200 ( 1 + 0.15 ( 70 / 365 ) ) = $ 19 752.33
savings would be $ 20 000 − $ 19 752.33 = $ 247.67
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (A).

The discount is 4 / 30 * 20000 = $ 266.67. So the merchant can afford to pay 20000 - 266.67 = $ 19733.33. The interest on this amount for 30 days at r% per annum is (19733.33 * r * 30) / 36500 = $ 247.67. So the highest rate of interest at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is 247.67 / 19733.33 * 100 = 1.25%.

***********************************
ANSWER: The cost of adding one soda and one energy bar is 150 cents . We need to purchase six sodas and seven bars . We know two sodas and three bars costs 300 cents , so to that purchase , we ' d need to add four sodas and four bars - or four sets of items . So , we take the initial 300 + ( 4 * 150 ) = 300 + 600 = 900 .
Answer - E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let s be the cost of a soda and b be the cost of an energy bar.

We know that s + 2b = 150 and 2s + 3b = 300.

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get s + b = 150.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get 150 + 2b = 150, so b = 0.

Therefore, s = 150.

So, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6s + 7b = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900.

**The answer is (E).**

QUESTION: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens . Company knows that on average 10 % of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing . Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs . 10 each . It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25 % . What is the manufactured cost of each pen ?['A ) Rs . 6', 'B ) Rs . 7.2', 'C ) Rs . 5.6', 'D ) Rs . 8', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: The company is able to deliver 90 % of the manufactured pens . Means to produce 7200 pens they must have to produce 8000 pens as 10 % are defectives . So , let K be the manufacturing price of each pen .
Total income ( including 25 % profit ) = 8000 * K * 1.25
This same income is obtained by selling 90 % manufactured pens at Rs . 10 which is equal to 7200 * 10 .
Thus ,
8000 * K * 1.25 = 7200 * 10
K = Rs . 7.2 . [ 90 % of 8000 = 7200 ]
Answer : Option B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Total number of pens produced = 7200
        No. of defective pens = 7200 * 10 / 100 = 720
        Net number of pens supplied = 7200 - 720 = 6480
        Cost price of each pen = (6480 * 100) / 125 = Rs. 5.6

2 x + 2 y - 2 ≤ L ( x , y ) ≤ 2 x + 2 y
= > a – 2 ≤ R ≤ a
Therefore , L ≤ R .
Answer : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let x = 1 and y = 1. Then, L(x, y) = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, and R(x, y) = 2 + 2 = 4. So, L(x, y) = R(x, y).

Let x = 1 and y = 2. Then, L(x, y) = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, and R(x, y) = 2 + 4 = 6. So, L(x, y) = R(x, y).

Let x = 2 and y = 1. Then, L(x, y) = 2 + 1 + 2 = 5, and R(x, y) = 4 + 2 = 6. So, L(x, y) < R(x, y).

Let x = 2 and y = 2. Then, L(x, y) = 2 + 2 + 3 = 7, and R(x, y) = 4 + 4 = 8. So, L(x, y) < R(x, y).

From the above examples, we can see that it is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x, y) = R(x, y), L(x, y) < R(x, y), and L(x, y) > R(x, y).

Therefore, the correct answer is E.

ANSWER: We must plug in the three points that satisfy y < 0 < b < x < a .
Only C satisfies the area of a triangle .
Answer :
C . ( by − ay ) / 2
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Step 1: The area of a triangle is given by the formula A = 1 / 2 * b * h, where b is the base and h is the height.

Step 2: In this case, the base is the distance between the points (a, 0) and (b, 0), which is b - a. The height is the distance between the points (a, 0) and (x, y), which is y.

Step 3: Substituting these values into the formula for the area of a triangle, we get A = 1 / 2 * (b - a) * y = (by - ay) / 2.

Therefore, the answer is (C).

If 50 % of the files were not infected by a virus , how many of Sam ' s files were NOT infected by a worm ?['A ) 50', 'B ) 70', 'C ) 75', 'D ) 100', 'E ) 125']
***********************************
ANSWER: n ( Total ) = 250
n ( only worm ) = 125 ( 50 % of total )
n ( only worm ) = 2.5 * n ( both worm and virus )
So ,
n ( both worn and virus ) = 125 / 2.5 = 50
n ( Total ) = n ( only worm ) + n ( both worm and virus ) + n ( only virus )
n ( only virus ) = 250 - 125 - 50 = 75
Hence , the files not infected by worm is n ( Only virus ) = 75
ANSWER : ( Option C )
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let x be the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. Then 2.5x is the number of files that are infected only by a worm. So 2.5x + x = 250. 3.5x = 250. x = 250 / 3.5 = 70. So 70 files are infected by both a virus and a worm. Thus 250 - 70 = 180 files are not infected by a virus. 50% of the files are not infected by a virus. Thus 100% - 50% = 50% of the files are infected by a worm. Thus 180 * 50 / 100 = 90 files are infected by a worm. So 180 - 90 = 90 files are not infected by a worm.

The answer: (C).

Find Mohan ' s share .['A ) 2400', 'B ) 2500', 'C ) 2600', 'D ) 2700', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let , the amount Mohan and Sohan receive be Rs . m and Rs . n , respectively . The amount that they receive 3 years and 2 years after should be equal .
⇒ m ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) 3 = n ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) 2
⇒ m ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) = n
⇒ m ( 26 / 25 ) = n
⇒ m / n = 25 / 26
Therefore , Rs . 5100 must be distribued in the ratio 25 : 26
So Mohan ' s share = 5100 × 25 / ( 25 + 26 ) = 2500
Answer B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let Mohan's share be Rs x.

Then, Sohan's share = 5100 - x

ATQ, (x*26*26*4)/100 = (5100 - x*24*24*4)/100

⇒ 26x = 5100 - 24x

⇒ 4x = 5100

⇒ x = 1275

∴ Mohan's share = Rs 1275.

QUESTION: A coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm ( it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm ) . If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver , what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum ?['A ) 36 grams', 'B ) 40 grams', 'C ) 42 grams', 'D ) 48 grams', 'E ) 50 grams']
***********************************
ANSWER: Coin is basically a cylinder .
So volume of coin T = pi r ^ 2 h = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 * 2
Coin = Silver + Aluminum
Now total volume of coin ( T ) = volume of silver + volume of aluminum
Also , volume of silver ( Vs ) = volume of aluminum ( Va )
T = Va + Vb
T = 2 Va
Va = T / 2 = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 * 2 / 2 = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2
Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum .
Let the weight of aluminum in coin be x
Weight of Silver = 2 x
Total weight of coin = 30
x + 2 x = 30
x = 10
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10 gm
Wright of Silver in coin is 20 gm .
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10 gm and volume is pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2
Now new Aluminum coin is made with dimension 1 x 30 mm .
Volume of this new coin = pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 .
Volume of pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 contains weight of 10 gm of aluminum
Volume of pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 will contain = 10 / pi ( 7.5 ) ^ * pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 = 40 gm
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The volume of the coin is 2 x 15 x 2 = 60 mm^3. The weight of the silver in the coin is 30 x 2 = 60 grams. The weight of the aluminum in the coin is 30 - 60 = -30 grams. The weight of the aluminum coin is 30 x 2 = 60 grams.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. The volume of the coin is 2 x 15 x 2 = 60 mm^3.
2. The weight of the silver in the coin is 30 x 2 = 60 grams.
3. The weight of the aluminum in the coin is 30 - 60 = -30 grams.
4. The weight of the aluminum coin is 30 x 2 = 60 grams.

QUESTION: What is the largest integral value of ' k ' for which the quadratic equation x 2 - 5 x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots ?['A ) 9', 'B ) 7', 'C ) 3', 'D ) 8', 'E ) 12']
***********************************
ANSWER: Any quadratic equation will have real and distinct roots if the discriminant D > 0
The discriminant ' D ' of a quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 is given by b 2 - 4 ac
In this question , the value of D = 52 - 4 * 1 * k
If D > 0 , then 25 > 4 k or k < 6.2 .
Therefore , the highest integral value that k can take is 3 .
correct choice is ( C )
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The quadratic equation x 2 - 5 x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots if its discriminant, b 2 - 4ac, is greater than zero. In this case, b = -5, a = 1, and c = k. So, the discriminant is (-5) 2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k. This must be greater than zero, so 25 - 4k > 0. Subtracting 25 from both sides, we get -4k > -25. Dividing both sides by -4, we get k < 6.25. The largest integral value of k that satisfies this inequality is 6.

So, the answer is (D).

There were four feeding sessions .
The amount remaining just before noon was ( 2 / 3 ) ^ 4 = 16 / 81 , which is about 20 % .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (D).

At 8:00 AM, the dog ate 1 / 3 of the food in the bowl. So at 9:00 AM, the dog ate 1 / 3 of the food that was left after 8:00 AM, which is 1 / 3 * 2 / 3 = 2 / 9 of the original food. At 10:00 AM, the dog ate 1 / 3 of the food that was left after 9:00 AM, which is 1 / 3 * 2 / 9 = 2 / 27 of the original food. At 11:00 AM, the dog ate 1 / 3 of the food that was left after 10:00 AM, which is 1 / 3 * 2 / 27 = 2 / 81 of the original food. So at noon, the dog had eaten 1 - (2 / 9 + 2 / 27 + 2 / 81) = 40 / 81 = 40% of the original food.

of 55 . If the overall class average was 76 , what percent of the class passed ?['A ) 44 %', 'B ) 66 %', 'C ) 68 %', 'D ) 72 %', 'E ) 75 %']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let p = proportion that passed . Then 83 p + 55 ( 1 - p ) = 76 , so p = 21 / 28 = 75
correct answer E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let x be the number of passing students and y be the number of failing students. Then x + y = total number of students = 100. The average of the passing students is 83, so x(83) = total marks of passing students = 83x. The average of the failing students is 55, so y(55) = total marks of failing students = 55y. The total marks of the class is (x + y)(76) = 76(x + y). Equating the two expressions for the total marks, we get 83x + 55y = 76(x + y). Simplifying, we get 7x = 21y. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 3y. Substituting this into the equation x + y = 100, we get 3y + y = 100. Combining like terms, we get 4y = 100. Dividing both sides by 4, we get y = 25. Therefore, x = 3y = 3 * 25 = 75. So 75 of the students passed, which is 75 / 100 = 75%. The answer is (E).

II . Q is the fourth power of a prime number .
III . Q is the product of two prime numbers .['A ) I only', 'B ) III only', 'C ) II only', 'D ) I and II only', 'E ) I and III only']
***********************************
ANSWER: If Q has 5 factors , we can represent Q = a ^ 4 , where a is positive integer more than 1 . Let ' s assume that ` ` a ' ' is not a prime number . Let a = kp , where both k and p are positive integers .
Thus , Q = ( kp ) 4 = k 4 ∗ p 4 ( kp ) 4 = k 4 ∗ p 4 . Now the number of factors of Q = ( 4 + 1 ) * ( 4 + 1 ) = 25 . But as the given condition states that Q has ONLY 5 factors , thus ` ` a ' ' ca n ' t have any other factor except 1 and itself . Thus , a = prime number .
Statement I : We can represent Q = ( a ^ 2 ) ^ 2 . Thus , we have to prove whether a ^ 2 is a prime number . Take a = 2 . We can see that it is not a prime number . Thus , this option ca n ' t answer a ` ` MUST be true question ' '
Statement II : Always true as proved above .
Statement III : Again take a = 2 . Thus , Q = 64 . We do n ' t have this as product of 2 primes .
The Answer is , B .

QUESTION: At the of his one - year investment , Charles received $ 54,080 , including interest and principal from a certain investment . If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi - annually , which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested ?['A ) $ 45,000', 'B ) $ 50,000', 'C ) $ 54,000', 'D ) $ 59,000', 'E ) $ 62,000']
***********************************
ANSWER: You are given that a certain investment gave you X $ after 1 year . So the original investment must be < X
Thus you can rule out options D - E as these options will make the original amount > the interest + principle amount
Option C is very close to the amount after 1 st year and 4 % will definitely give you > 80 $ in interests .
Now you only have 2 options left ( A and B )
Per the question , let x be the original amount invested - - - > x ( 1.04 ) ^ 2 = 54080 .
This clearly shows that answer must be B .
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

We know that the amount of interest Charles received is $54,080 - $50,000 = $4080. Since the interest is compounded semi-annually, the rate of interest is 8 / 2 = 4% per half year. Therefore, the time period is 1 year = 2 half years. We can use the following formula to calculate the amount of money Charles originally invested:

```
A = P(1 + r)^n
```

Where:

* A is the amount of money Charles originally invested
* P is the amount of money Charles received after one year
* r is the rate of interest per half year
* n is the number of half years

Substituting the values into the formula, we get:

```
$50,000 = P(1 + 4%)^2
```

Solving for P, we get:

```
P = $45,000
```

Therefore, the answer is (A).

= 0.81 x 0.81 x 0.1 = 0.6561
ANSWER : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The probability of a registered voter in Burghtown voting in the last election is 90%. So the probability of a registered voter not voting in the last election is 10%.

If five registered voters are chosen at random, the probability that exactly four of them voted in the last election is:

```
P(4) = (5C4) * (0.9)^4 * (0.1)^1 = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1 = 3.28%
```

Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election is 32.8%.

QUESTION: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced . If the yard has an area of 240 square meters , how many meters of fencing does she need ?['A ) 58', 'B ) 62', 'C ) 66', 'D ) 70', 'E ) 74']
***********************************
ANSWER: The sides of the rectangle have a length of 10 and L .
The area is 10 * L = 240 so L = 24 .
She needs fencing with a length of 10 + 2 * 24 = 58 meters .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is (B).

Let's say the length of the yard is x and the width is y. Then, x * y = 240. Since one side is 10 meters long, the other two sides must be x - 10 and y - 10. So, 2 * (x - 10) + 2 * (y - 10) = 240. This simplifies to 2x + 2y - 40 = 240. Adding 40 to both sides, we get 2x + 2y = 280. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x + y = 140. Since x * y = 240, we can also say x = 240 / y. Substituting this into x + y = 140, we get 240 / y + y = 140. Multiplying both sides by y, we get 240 + y^2 = 140y. Subtracting 140y from both sides, we get y^2 - 140y + 240 = 0. This is a quadratic equation in y. We can use the quadratic formula to solve for y. The quadratic formula is -b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac) / 2a, where a is the coefficient of y^2, b is the coefficient of y, and c is the constant term. In this case, a = 1, b = -140, and c = 240. Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get y = -140 +- sqrt(140^2 - 4(1)(240)) / 2(1). This simplifies to y = -140 +- sqrt(19600) / 2. This simplifies to y = -140 +- 44. So, y = 30 or y = 74. Since the length of the yard is x and the width is y, and we know that y = 30, then x = 240 / 30 = 8. So, the length of the yard is 8 meters and the width is 30 meters. Since Alice is leaving one side of the yard unfenced, she needs to fence 3 sides. The length of the fence on each side is 8 meters, so she needs 3 * 8 = 24 meters of fencing.

QUESTION: Two friends are eating a jar full of candies . Had P eaten alone , it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar . Had Q eaten alone , it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar . Since both of them are eating simultaneously , how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar ?['A ) 4', 'B ) 5', 'C ) 6', 'D ) 7', 'E ) 8']
***********************************
ANSWER: Together they eat 1 / 10 + 1 / 10 = 1 / 5 of the jar per minute .
The time to finish the jar is 5 minutes .
The answer is B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

1. Let's first find the total number of candies in the jar. If it takes P 10 minutes to eat all the candies, then in one minute, he eats 1 / 10 of the candies. If it takes Q 5 minutes to eat half the jar, then in one minute, she eats 1 / 5 * 2 = 2 / 5 of the candies. So, in one minute, both of them eat 1 / 10 + 2 / 5 = 7 / 10 of the candies. Therefore, it will take them 10 / 7 = 1.42857142857 minutes to empty the jar.

2. Rounding this number to the nearest whole minute, we get 1 minute.

3. Therefore, the answer is (B).
