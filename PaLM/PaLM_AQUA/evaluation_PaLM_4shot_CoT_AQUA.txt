QUESTION: A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?['A ) 5 ( √ 3 + 1 )', 'B ) 6 ( √ 3 + √ 2 )', 'C ) 7 ( √ 3 – 1 )', 'D ) 8 ( √ 3 – 2 )', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h . Initially , he was at an angle of 450 . tan 45 = h / distance between car and tower . h = distance between car and tower ( since tan 45 = 1 ) .
Now , after 10 minutes , it travelled a certain distance , and angle changed to 600 .
tan 60 = h / x x = h / √ 3
So , in 10 minutes , it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h / √ 3 .
10 minutes = h * ( 1 – 1 √ 3 )
h can be travelled in 10 / ( 1 – 1 √ 3 ) .
To travel a distance of x , which is h / √ 3 , it takes :
h = 10 / ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 )
h / √ 3 = 10 / √ 3 * ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 ) . Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √ 3 ( conjugate of 1 - √ 3 ) . We get , x = h / √ 3 = 10 ( 1 + √ 3 ) / 2 = 5 * ( 1 + √ 3 )
So , it takes 5 ( 1 + √ 3 ) minutes to reach the base of the tower .
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the height of the tower be h.

In ∆ABC, tan 45° = h/x1 and tan 60° = h/x2

⇒ x1/x2 = 1/√3

⇒ x2 = √3x1

⇒ x1 + x2 = √3x1 + x1 = (√3 + 1)x1

⇒ Time taken to reach the base of the tower = (√3 + 1)x1/v = (√3 + 1)10/v minutes

⇒ Time taken to reach the base of the tower = (√3 + 1)10/v minutes

⇒ Time taken to reach the base of the tower = 5(√3 + 1) minutes.

So, the answer is (A).

QUESTION: The original price of an item is discounted 22 % . A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $ 20 - off coupon . There is no tax on the item , and this was the only item the customer bought . If the customer paid $ 1.90 more than half the original price of the item , what was the original price of the item ?['A ) $ 61', 'B ) $ 65', 'C ) $ 67.40', 'D ) $ 70', 'E ) $ 78.20']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let x be the original price of the item
Discounted price = 0.78 x
Payment made by the customer after using the $ 20 coupon = 0.78 x - 20
0.78 x - 20 = x / 2 + 1.9
x = 78.20
Answer : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The original price of the item is 100%. Discounted price is 100 - 22 = 78% of the original price. The customer paid 78% - 20 = 58% of the original price. So the customer paid 58 / 100 * x = x + 1.90. Solving for x, we get x = 67.40.

The answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: 450 * 12 ( x - 110 ) = 626400
where x is a selling cost of one item
x - 110 , is a profit from one item
450 - number of items produced and sold per month
12 - is a number of month in a year
Simplifying the equation will lead to x - 110 = 116 , then x = 230
B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is (B).

The company produces 420 components per month, so in a year it produces 420 * 12 = 5040 components. The company wants to make a profit of at least $626,400. So the minimum selling price per component must be $626,400 / 5040 = $125.2. Rounding up to the nearest dollar, the minimum selling price per component is $126.

The company's production cost per component is $110. So the company's minimum profit per component is $126 - $110 = $16.

The company wants to make a profit of at least $16 per component. So the company must sell each component for at least $16 + $110 = $126.

The minimum selling price per component is $126. Rounding up to the nearest dollar, the minimum selling price per component is $126.

X = Total staplers
0.1 X = defective staplers
0.9 X = normal staplers
Next , we ' re told that 2 % of the normal staplers were rejected by mistake and that this = 72 staplers .
0.9 X ( 0.02 ) = 72
0.018 X = 72
18 X = 72,000
X = 4,000
Final Answer :
A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is: (B)

Let's solve step-by-step:

Let's assume the number of staplers produced that day = x

Number of defective staplers = 10 / 100 * x = x / 10

Number of non - defective staplers = x - x / 10 = 9x / 10

Number of non - defective staplers rejected = 2 / 100 * 9x / 10 = 9x / 500

72 = 9x / 500

x = 72 * 500 / 9 = 4200

***********************************
ANSWER: P ( A / B ) = P ( A n B ) / P ( B )
Here , P ( A n B ) = 0.16
P ( A / B ) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2
A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Given P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8, we know that P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16.

Since A and B are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B).

So P(A / B) = P(A ∩ B) / P(B) = 0.16 / 0.8 = 0.2.

The answer is (A).

QUESTION: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys . Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy , and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy . During a month , both of them makes 35 toys in total . If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob ?['A ) 15', 'B ) 16', 'C ) 17', 'D ) 18', 'E ) 19']
***********************************
ANSWER: Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs . , and Jacob has worked for y hrs . So , number of toys prepared by Alex is x / 7 , and Jacob is y / 9 . Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35 .
= > x / 7 + y / 9 = 35 .
= > 9 x + 7 y = ( 35 ) ( 63 )
= > 7 y = ( 35 ) ( 63 ) - 9 x
= > y = ( 5 ) ( 63 ) - ( 9 / 7 ) x
= > y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) x
= > x is to be a multiple of 7 . Also , we need to minimize the difference between x & y . Here are some possible values ,
x = 126 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 126 = 153
x = 133 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 133 = 144
x = 140 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 140 = 135
x = 147 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs . and y is 135 hrs . Thus total toys created by Jacob = y / 9 = 135 / 9 = 15 .

QUESTION: When folded into two equal halves a rectangular sheet had a perimeter of 48 cm for each part folded along one set of sides and the same is 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides . Find the area of the sheet .['A ) 1584', 'B ) 1120', 'C ) 792', 'D ) 1320', 'E ) 1200']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let the sheet be folded along its breadth and its perimeter = 48 cm
Therefore , ( l / 2 + b ) = 48 . . . ( i )
Now , let the sheet be folded along its length , and the perimeter = 66 cm
( l + b / 2 ) = 66 … . . . ( ii )
Solving ( i ) and ( ii ) , we get ,
l = 56 cm , b = 20 cm
Area = l * b
Area = 1120 cm 2
ANSWER IS B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let the length and breadth of the sheet be L and B respectively.

When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48 cm. So, 2(L + B) = 48

When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66 cm. So, 2(L + B) = 66

Adding the two equations, we get 4(L + B) = 114

Substituting the value of 2(L + B) from the first equation, we get 4L + 4B = 114

Dividing both sides by 4, we get L + B = 28

Squaring both sides, we get (L + B)^2 = 784

Substituting the value of (L + B) from the first equation, we get (2L + 2B)^2 = 784

Expanding the equation, we get 4L^2 + 4B^2 + 8LB = 784

Subtracting 8LB from both sides, we get 4L^2 + 4B^2 = 784 - 8LB

Taking 4 common from both sides, we get 4(L^2 + B^2) = 784 - 8LB

Dividing both sides by 4, we get (L^2 + B^2) = 196 - 2LB

The area of the sheet is (L^2 + B^2). Substituting the value of (L^2 + B^2) from the above equation, we get Area = 196 - 2LB

Substituting the value of L + B from the first equation, we get Area = 196 - 2(28)

Simplifying, we get Area = 196 - 56 = 140

So, the answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Assume there are total of 100 students . 24 students are members of both clubs . We are told that : 20 % of members of the swim team are not members of the chess club , thus if S is a # of members of the swim team then 0.2 S is # of members of only the swim teem :
24 + 0.2 S = S - - > S = 30 .
Answer : B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: 

Let X be the number of students who are members of both the chess club and the swim team. Let Y be the number of students who are members of the swim team but not the chess club. Let Z be the number of students who are members of the chess club but not the swim team. Let W be the number of students who are not members of either the chess club or the swim team.

We know that X + Y + Z + W = 100%. We also know that X + Y = 24%. And we know that Y = 20% of Z. Substituting the second equation into the first equation, we get X + 20% of Z + Z + W = 100%. Combining like terms, we get X + 21% of Z + W = 100%. Subtracting 21% of Z from both sides, we get X + W = 100% - 21% of Z. Multiplying both sides by 100, we get 100X + 100W = 10000 - 2100 of Z. Dividing both sides by 100, we get X + W = 100 - 21 of Z.

We can now substitute the third equation into the fourth equation, to get X + W = 100 - 21 of (20% of Z). Combining like terms, we get X + W = 100 - 420 of Z. Subtracting W from both sides, we get X = 100 - 420 of Z - W.

We can now substitute the fifth equation into the first equation, to get 100 - 420 of Z - W + Y + Z + W = 100%. Combining like terms, we get 100 - 420 of Z + Y = 100%. Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get -420 of Z + Y = 0. Dividing both sides by -420, we get Z + Y = 0.

Substituting the second equation into the sixth equation, we get Z + 24% = 0. Subtracting 24% from both sides, we get Z = -24%. Substituting this value into the third equation, we get Y = 20% of -24%. Combining like terms, we get Y = -4.8%. Substituting this value into the fourth equation, we get X = 100 - 420 of (-4.8%) - W. Combining like terms, we get X = 100 + 193.6 - W. Subtracting 100 from both sides, we get X + W = 93.6.

The answer is 93.6%.

***********************************
ANSWER: Required number of ways = 10 C 2 = 10 * 9 / 2 = 45
Answer is A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: 
        The answer is (D).

        The number of ways of choosing 2 oranges from 10 oranges is 10C2 = 10! / 8! * 2! = 45.

        However, this includes the cases where the same orange is chosen twice. So we need to subtract the number of ways of choosing the same orange twice.

        The number of ways of choosing the same orange twice is 10C1 * 10C1 = 10 * 10 = 100.

        So the final answer is 10C2 - 10C1 * 10C1 = 100 - 100 = 0.

***********************************
ANSWER: We have to find the LCM :
17 is a prime number which means the LCM of 16 and 17 has to be 16 * 17 = 272
Correct answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

The answer is (B).

Let's think step-by-step.

Train A leaves the station every 16 minutes, so in 1 minute, Train A has left 1 / 16 of the way around the track. Train B leaves the station every 17 minutes, so in 1 minute, Train B has left 1 / 17 of the way around the track. In 1 minute, Train A and Train B have left 1 / 16 + 1 / 17 = 23 / 102 of the way around the track. It will take 102 / 23 = 4.4 minutes for Train A and Train B to meet again. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take 4.4 * 60 = 264 minutes for Train A and Train B to meet again.

Therefore, the answer is (B).

QUESTION: A hollow cube of size 5 cm is taken , with the thickness of 1 cm . It is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm . If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted ?['A ) 438', 'B ) 550', 'C ) 500', 'D ) 450', 'E ) 498']
***********************************
ANSWER: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L 3 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 cm 3
Size of hollow cube ( considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3 cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 cm 3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm 3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 cm 3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes ( 6 faces each cube has ) = 98 * 6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6 * L 2 = 6 * 5 * 5 = 150 cm 2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1 * 1 = 1 cm 2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150 / 1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted = 588 - 150
= 438
answer . A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Number of unpainted faces = 6 * 6 - 4 * 4 = 498
        So the answer is (E).

QUESTION: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books . She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters . If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters , what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books ? ( Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter . )['A ) 3', 'B ) 4', 'C ) 5', 'D ) 10', 'E ) 20']
***********************************
ANSWER: The question asks for the smallest value of n , such that ( n + nC 2 ) = 10 ( n represents the number of letters . In this equation , n by itself is for single - letter codes and nC 2 is for two - letter codes ) .
At this point , you ' d need to pick numbers , since there ' s really no easy way to solve nC 2 = ( 10 – n ) without a calculator .
Looking at the answer choices , you can eliminate 10 and 20 , so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test . ( i . e . ( 10 – n ) suggests n can not be less than 10 . )
As a general rule , whenever you ' re asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition , start by testing the smallest number in the answers . Conversely , if you ' re asked for the largest value , start with the greatest answer .
Plug - in n = 4 to ( n + nC 2 ) = ( 4 + 4 C 2 ) = 4 + ( 4 x 3 / 2 ) = ( 4 + 6 ) = 10 ANS : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Step-by-step explanation:

If Amy uses a single letter to code each book, she will need 10 letters. If Amy uses a pair of two different letters to code each book, she will need 10 * 2 = 20 letters. Since 20 is greater than 10, Amy will need the smallest number of letters if she uses a single letter to code each book. The answer is (A).

QUESTION: A rectangular piece of 150 sq m has a length which is 1 m more than the 4 times the breadth . What is the perimeter of the piece ?['A ) 60 m', 'B ) 61 m', 'C ) 62 m', 'D ) 63 m', 'E ) 64 m']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let its breadth be = x m .
So length will be = ( 4 x + 1 ) m .
Now ,
x * ( 4 x + 1 ) = 150
or , 4 x ^ 2 + x - 150 = 0
or , ( 4 x + 25 ) ( x - 6 ) = 0
Either 4 x = - 25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4 * 6 + 1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2 * ( 25 + 6 ) = 62 mLet its breadth be = x m .
So length will be = ( 4 x + 1 ) m .
Now ,
x * ( 4 x + 1 ) = 150
or , 4 x ^ 2 + x - 150 = 0
or , ( 4 x + 25 ) ( x - 6 ) = 0
Either 4 x = - 25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4 * 6 + 1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2 * ( 25 + 6 ) = 62 m
ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the breadth of the rectangular piece be x m.
        So, the length of the rectangular piece = 4x + 1 m
        Area of the rectangular piece = 150 sq m
        ⇒ x(4x + 1) = 150
        ⇒ 4x2 + x – 150 = 0
        ⇒ (4x + 15)(x – 10) = 0
        ⇒ x = 10 or x = -15
        Since length cannot be negative, x = 10 m
        So, the length of the rectangular piece = 4(10) + 1 = 41 m
        And the breadth of the rectangular piece = 10 m
        So, the perimeter of the rectangular piece = 2(41 + 10) = 102 m
        The answer is (D).

QUESTION: A ship went on a voyage . After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship . Find the distance when they meet from starting point .['A ) 238', 'B ) 289', 'C ) 200', 'D ) 287', 'E ) 187']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let the speed of the ship = m miles / hr . and plane took ' t ' hours to meet the ship
Then , m × t is the distance ship traveled after plane started
So we have , mt + 180 = 10 mt
⇒ 9 mt = 180
⇒ mt = 20
Hence distance = 180 + 20 = 200 miles
Answer : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let's think step-by-step.
        Let the speed of the ship be x. Then, the speed of the plane is 10x. The total distance traveled by the ship and the plane is 180 + x(t) + 10x(t) = 11x(t).
        Since the ship and the plane meet at the same time, we can equate the two expressions for the total distance traveled.
        180 + x(t) + 10x(t) = 11x(t)
        180 = 1x(t)
        x(t) = 180 miles.
        The total distance traveled by the ship and the plane when they meet is 180 + 180 = 360 miles.
        Therefore, the answer is (C).

QUESTION: In a large forest , 300 deer were caught , tagged , and returned during 2001 . During 2002 , 500 deer were caught at random , of which only 20 had tags from the previous year . If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags , what is the total deer population in the forest ( assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002 ) ?['A ) 300', 'B ) 500', 'C ) 5000', 'D ) 6000', 'E ) 7500']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let N = the total number of deer in the forest .
During the first year , the percent of deer in the entire population with tags was : 300 / N
20 / 500 is the percent of deer caught during the second year that had tags . Since this sample percent matches the percent for the entire population ( i . e . , the total number of tagged deer divided by the total number of deer ) , the two ratios are equal .
Equating these two percents :
Sample = Population
( 20 / 500 ) = ( 300 / N )
N = ( 300 / 1 ) * ( 500 / 20 )
N = 7500
Answer E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

(20 / 500) * 300 = 120 deer were tagged in the forest. So the total population of deer in the forest is 120 / .2 = 6000. The answer is (D).

QUESTION: Boomtown urban planners expect the city ’ s population to increase by 10 % per year over the next two years . If that projection were to come true , the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago . Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year ?['A ) 20 %', 'B ) 40 %', 'C ) 50 %', 'D ) 65 %', 'E ) 75 %']
***********************************
ANSWER: Population now - 100 ;
Population one year from now - 110 ;
Population two years from now - 121 ;
Since the population two years from now ( 121 ) is exactly double the population one year ago then the population one year ago was 121 / 2 = 60.5 .
Now , the question asks about the population increase over the last year , so from 60.5 ( last year ) to 100 ( now ) : percent increase = difference / original * 100 = ( 100 - 60.5 ) / 60.5 * 100 = 39.5 / 60.5 * 100 = ~ 2 / 3 * 100 = ~ 65 % .
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let P be the population of Boomtown one year ago. Two years from now, the population will be P * 2. If the population increases by 10% per year, then the population one year from now will be P * 1.1. So P * 1.1 * 1.1 = P * 2, which means 1.1 * 1.1 = 2. So the population increased by 100 * (2 - 1.1 * 1.1) / 1.1 * 1.1 = 50% over the last year. The answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: Suppose Arun has $ X and Sajal has $ Y . then ,
2 ( x - 30 ) = y + 30 = > 2 x - y = 90 … ( i )
and x + 10 = 3 ( y - 10 ) = > x - 3 y = - 40 … ( ii )
Solving ( i ) and ( ii ) , we get x = 62 and y = 34 .
Arun has $ 62 and Sajal has $ 34 .
Answer B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the money with Arjun be x and that with Sajal be y.

When Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, x - 30 = 2y

When Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, y + 10 = 3(x - 10)

Substituting the value of x from equation 1 into equation 2, we get

y + 10 = 3(x - 30 - 10)

y + 10 = 3(x - 40)

y + 10 = 3x - 120

10 + 120 = 3x - y

130 = 3x - y

3x = 130 + y

x = (130 + y) / 3

Substituting the value of x from equation 1 into equation 2, we get

y + 10 = 3((130 + y) / 3 - 40)

y + 10 = 3(40 + y) / 3 - 120

y + 10 = 40 + y - 120

20 = 3y - 110

3y = 20 + 110

3y = 130

y = 130 / 3 = 43

Substituting the value of y in equation 1, we get

x = (130 + 43) / 3 = 62

Therefore, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $43.

The answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let x be the length of one side of the original square .
The area of the rectangle is x ( x - 4 ) = 140 .
x = 14 .
The perimeter of the square was 4 * 14 = 56 feet .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the side of the square be x feet.
Perimeter of square = 4x feet
Area of square = x2 square feet
After trimming 4 feet from one edge , the side of the rectangle = (x - 4) feet
Area of rectangle = (x - 4)(x) = x2 - 4x square feet
After cutting the rectangle diagonally , we get 2 triangles of equal area
Area of each triangle = (x2 - 4x)/2 = 70 square feet
x2 - 4x = 140
x2 = 140 + 4x
x = √144 = 12 feet
Perimeter of square = 4x = 4 * 12 = 48 feet

The answer: A).

***********************************
ANSWER: From the given data ,
abc – cba + 396 c = 990
100 a + 10 b + c – ( 100 c + 10 b + a ) + 396 c = 990
99 a – 99 c + 396 c = 990
Observe that each term is divisible by 99 . So on dividing the above expression by 99 , we get
a – c + 4 c = 10
a + 3 c = 10
For c = 1 , a = 7
c = 2 , a = 4
c = 3 , a = 1
' b ' can take any value from 0 to 9
We have to find the value of M more than 300 . So minimum value of ' a ' should be 4 .
So total possibilities are 402 , 412 , . . . . , 492 = 10 values
701 , 711 , . . . . . , 791 = 10 values
So total values = 20 .
Correct option : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

```
Given that M > N and M - N + 396 c = 990

Let's assume that M = 300 + x
N = 300 - x

Substituting these values in the equation, we get

300 + x - (300 - x) + 396c = 990

600 + 396c = 990

396c = 390

c = 10

So, for every value of x from 1 to 10, M will be more than 300.

Therefore, the number of values of M that are more than 300 is 10.

The answer is (A).

QUESTION: The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed . When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs . 1800 . In another month 620 calls are consumed then the bill becomes Rs . 2040 . In another month 500 units are consumed due to more
holidays . The bill for that month would be :['A ) Rs . 1560', 'B ) Rs . 1680', 'C ) Rs . 1840', 'D ) Rs . 1950', 'E ) Rs . 1690']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let the fixed amount be Rs . X and the cost of each unit be Rs . Y .
Then , 540 y + x = 1800 … . And 620 y + x = 2040
On subtracting ( i ) from ( ii ) , we get 80 y = 240 - > y = 3
Putting y = 3 in ( i ) we get :
540 * 3 + x = 1800 x = ( 1800 - 1620 ) = 180
. : Fixed charges = Rs . 180 , Charge per unit = Rs . 3 .
Total charges for consuming 500 units = 180 + ( 500 * 3 ) = Rs . 1680
Answer : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let the fixed charge be Rs. x and the charge per call be Rs. y.

540x + 540y = 1800
620x + 620y = 2040

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get -80x = -240

So, x = 3.

The bill for 500 calls would be 500x + 500y = 1500 + 1500 = 3000.

The answer is (A).

QUESTION: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track . Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes . Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes . If they start rotating now from the same point , when will they be at the same starting point again ?['A ) 1 hour and 31 minutes', 'B ) 2 hour and 31 minutes', 'C ) 3 hour and 31 minutes', 'D ) 4 hour and 31 minutes', 'E ) 5 hour and 31 minutes']
***********************************
ANSWER: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes , it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes . If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes , it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes .
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points . Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations . Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T . Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point . Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13 . The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13 . Hence
X = 7 ( 13 ) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes
correct answer A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (B).

The time taken by Ball A to complete one rotation is 26 / 2 = 13 minutes. The time taken by Ball B to complete one rotation is 35 / 5 = 7 minutes. The least common multiple of 13 and 7 is 91. So, after 91 minutes, both the balls will be at the same starting point again. 91 minutes is 2 hours and 31 minutes.

***********************************
ANSWER: Let , n be the number of members in the club . Then ,
250 = ( n x [ 2 × 7 + ( n + 1 ) × 3 / 12 ] ) / 2 .
n = 25 .
Hence , the number of members in the club is 25 .
Answer : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the number of members in the club be n.

The ages of the members of the club are 7, 7 + 3, 7 + 3(2), 7 + 3(3) …. 7 + 3(n - 1).

The sum of the ages of all the members = 7 + (7 + 3) + (7 + 3(2)) + (7 + 3(3)) + …. + (7 + 3(n - 1)) = 7n + 3(n(n - 1)) / 2

7n + 3(n(n - 1)) / 2 = 250

7n + 3n(n - 1) = 500

3n(n - 1) = 500 - 7n

3n(n - 1) = 423

n(n - 1) = 141

n2 - n - 141 = 0

(n - 17)(n + 8) = 0

n = 17 or n = -8

Since n cannot be negative, n = 17.

The number of members in the club = 17.

The answer is (A).

***********************************
ANSWER: Distance covered by train A before the train B leaves
Mumbai Central = 40 × 3 = 120 km
Time taken to cross each other = 120 ⁄ 12 = 10 hours
Required time = 2 pm + 10 = 12 am on the next day
Answer A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

***********************************
ANSWER: B bisects minor arc AC means Arc BC is 80 degrees . Now , we have arc BD = 150 , therefore CD = 70 .
Now , Arc AC = 160 , CD = 70 = > Arc AD = 360 - 230 = 130
Answer B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's think step-by-step.

We know that m(AC) + m(BD) = 360°. Since m(AC) = 160° and m(BD) = 150°, we can substitute these values into the equation to get 160° + 150° = 310°. Since B bisects minor arc AC, m(AC) = 2m(AD). We can substitute this value into the equation to get 2m(AD) + 150° = 310°. Subtracting 150° from both sides of the equation, we get 2m(AD) = 160°. Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get m(AD) = 80°.

What is the distance traveled , in centimeters , by this point after 30 seconds when the fan runs at the rate of 300 revolutions per minutes ?['A ) 750 pi', 'B ) 1500 pi', 'C ) 1875 pi', 'D ) 3000 pi', 'E ) 7500 pi']
***********************************
ANSWER: 60 seconds - 300 revolutions
30 seconds - 150 revolutions
distance travelled in 1 revolution = 2 * pi * r
distance travelled in 150 revolutions = 300 * pi * r
= 3000 pi
Answer is D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (C).

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade is the circumference of the fan blade. The circumference of the fan blade is 2 * pi * r, where r is the radius of the fan blade. In this case, r = 10 cm. So the circumference of the fan blade is 2 * pi * 10 = 20 * pi cm.

The fan is rotating at a rate of 300 revolutions per minute. This means that it is rotating at a rate of 300 / 60 = 5 revolutions per second. So, in 30 seconds, the fan will rotate 30 * 5 = 150 revolutions.

The distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade in 150 revolutions is 150 * 20 * pi = 3000 * pi cm.

So, the answer is (C).

It means C was there in the business for 6 months . Given that B joined the business
after 2 months . Hence C joined after 4 months after B joined
Answer is B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's solve the question step-by-step.

(A + B + C)'s 1 month's profit = 40000/12 + 60000/12 + 120000/12 = Rs. 15000
So, (A + B + C)'s profit in 12 months = 15000 * 12 = Rs. 180000
So, B's share = (60000/180000) * 180000 = Rs. 60000
So, C's share = 180000 - 60000 = Rs. 120000
So, C joined after B joined for 120000/15000 = 8 months.

The final answer: E.

What is the distance between A and B ?['A ) 180', 'B ) 90', 'C ) 270', 'D ) 360', 'E ) None of the above']
***********************************
ANSWER: In the last 70 miles of his approach to B , Kevin was traveling at 70 mph , so he traveled that distance in 1 hr , or 60 minutes . That means , when he arrived at B , 60 minutes had elapsed , and he took ( 3 hr ) – ( 1 hr ) = 2 hr to drive the distance D at 90 mph .
D = RT = ( 90 mph ) [ ( 2 hr ] = 180 mi
Answer = ( A )
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the distance between A and B be x miles.
The time taken by Kevin to travel from A to B at a speed of 70 mph is x/70 hours.
The time taken by Kevin to travel from B to A at a speed of 90 mph is x/90 hours.
The total time taken by Kevin for the entire trip is (x/70 + x/90) hours.
Since the total time for the entire trip is 3 hours before the end of his trip, we have (x/70 + x/90) = 3.
Multiplying both sides by 2100, we get 3x + 2x = 6300.
Solving for x, we get x = 360 miles.

***********************************
ANSWER: Sum of the squares should be equal to 109 . Only Options B and D satisfying . When we subtract 495 , only 863 becomes 368
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the number be abc.
        a + b + c = 17
        a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
        a = 17 - (b + c)
        a^2 = (17 - (b + c))^2 = 289 + b^2 + c^2 - 34b - 34c
        Substituting the value of a^2 from equation 2 in equation 1, we get
        289 + b^2 + c^2 - 34b - 34c = 109
        b^2 + c^2 - 34b - 34c = -80
        b^2 + c^2 - 34(b + c) = -80
        b^2 + c^2 - 34(17 - (b + c)) = -80
        b^2 + c^2 + 516 - 34b - 34c = -80
        b^2 + c^2 + 136 - 34b - 34c = 0
        (b - 12) (b - 12) = 0
        b = 12
        a = 17 - (b + c) = 17 - (12 + c) = 5 - c
        c = 5 - a = 5 - 5 = 0
        The number is abc = 125.
        If we subtract 495 from the number, we get 125 - 495 = -370.
        The number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order is 370.
        The answer is (B).

***********************************
ANSWER: Since the store sold an equal number of white and yellow balls , 80 % / 2 = 40 % of the inventory at the start of the day was white balls . Then 60 % of the inventory consisted of yellow balls .
0.6 ( 600 ) = 360
The answer is E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is: B) 120

Step-by-step explanation:
The store had 600 golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. The store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 600 * .8 = 480 golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls and sold all of its white golf balls, that means it sold 480 / 2 = 240 yellow golf balls. So the store had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

***********************************
ANSWER: a 3 : a 3 / 8 * 4 / 3 π = > 6 : π
Answer : Option D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let's solve this question step-by-step.

        Let the side of the cube be a.

        Volume of the cube = a^3

        Volume of the sphere = (4/3)πr^3

        If the sphere fits inside the cube, then the diameter of the sphere will be equal to the side of the cube.

        ∴ r = a/2

        Substituting the value of r in the volume of the sphere, we get

        Volume of the sphere = (4/3)π(a/2)^3 = (4/3)πa^3/8

        So, the ratio of the volumes of the cube to that of the sphere is

        a^3/(4/3)πa^3/8 = 8/2 = 4 : 1

        The answer is (E).

pn = ( 0.85 p ) ( n + 5 ) - - > n = 0.85 ( n + 5 ) - - > n = 17 .
New price = 300 / ( n + 5 ) = 13.6 .
Answer : C .
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let the original price of each article be x.

Number of articles bought at original price = 300 / x

Number of articles bought at the new price = 300 / (x - 15 / 100 * x)

300 / x - 15 / 100 * 300 / x = 5

300 / x - 45 / 100 * 300 / x = 5

(75 / 100) * 300 / x = 5

(75 / 100) * 300 = 5 * x

x = (75 / 100) * 300 / 5 = $40

QUESTION: 10 kg of a mixture contains 30 % sand and 70 % clay . In order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand how much of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand ?['A ) 10 / 7', 'B ) 20 / 7', 'C ) 30 / 7', 'D ) 40 / 7', 'E ) 50 / 7']
***********************************
ANSWER: The mixture contains 3 kg sand and 7 kg clay .
For the mixture to be in equal quantities , there should be 2 kg of clay removed .
Clay and sand are in the ratio 7 : 3
So part of sand to be removed = 2 * 3 / 7 = 6 / 7
So total mixture to be removed = 2 + 6 / 7 = 20 / 7
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let's think step-by-step.
        The amount of sand in the mixture is 10 * 30 / 100 = 3 kg. The amount of clay in the mixture is 10 * 70 / 100 = 7 kg. The total amount of clay and sand in the mixture is 3 + 7 = 10 kg. We need to remove 7 / 2 = 3.5 kg of clay and replace it with sand. The amount of mixture that needs to be removed is 3.5 / 10 = 35 / 100. The amount of mixture that needs to be replaced with pure sand is 3 / 10. So, the amount of mixture that needs to be removed and replaced with pure sand is (35 / 100) + (3 / 10) = 40 / 100.

***********************************
ANSWER: Let Rs 100 be the income
Expenditure = Rs 70
Increased income = Rs 120
Expenditure in amount is same .
So , expenditure % = 70 / 120 * 100 = 58.3 %
ANSWER : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Let's solve the 5th question:

A man spends 70 % of his income. So his savings is 100 - 70 = 30 %. If his income increases by 20 %, his new income will be 120 % of his original income = 120/100 * 100 = 120. So his new savings will be 30/120 * 120 = 30. So his new expenditure will be 100 - 30 = 70.

QUESTION: If x < 0 , y > 0 , and | x ^ 3 | > | y ^ 2 | , which of the following must be true ?['A ) x > y', 'B ) y ^ 2 > x ^ 2', 'C ) - x ^ 3 < y ^ 2', 'D ) – x < y', 'E ) x < – y']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let ’ s go through each answer choice : ( A ) can never be true , since no negative is greater than a positive . ( B ) doesn ’ t have to be true – consider what would happen if x = - 2 and y = 1 . ( C ) can never be true , as x ^ 3 must be negative , and y ^ 2 must be positive . ( D ) can never be true , since if x < 0 , - x is the same thing as | x | , and | x | > y . ( E ) can be manipulated by multiplying both sides by - 1 , which gives us – x > y . Remember that x < 0 , so – x = | x | , and y is positive , so | y | = y . Thus – x ^ 3 > y ^ 2 is the same statement as | x ^ 3 | > | y ^ 2 | , and ( B ) must be true .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Since x < 0, |x| = -x. Since y > 0, |y| = y. So |x^3| = (-x)^3 = -x^3 and |y^2| = y^2.

Since |x^3| > |y^2|, -x^3 > y^2.

Since -x^3 > y^2, -x > y.

So the answer is (D).

QUESTION: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each . What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased ?['A ) 9 Trousers', 'B ) 8 Trousers', 'C ) 10 Trousers', 'D ) 7 Trousers', 'E ) 11 Trousers']
***********************************
ANSWER: Lets assume S as price of shirt and T as price of trousers , we have bellow equation :
70 T + 30 S = 810
Simplifying we get : 7 T + 3 S = 81
T = ( 81 - 3 * S ) / 7
We need to find the least value of S which will make ( 81 - 3 * S ) divisible by 7
Simplifying by taking 3 as common factor 3 * ( 27 - S ) / 7
Looking at the above equation its not difficult to find out least value of S is 6 so that 27 - 3 S becomes divisible by S
Hence , T = ( 81 - 3 * S ) / 7 = ( 81 - 3 * 6 ) / 7 = 63 / 7 = 9
ANSWER : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Let's think step-by-step.

Let x be the number of trouser and y be the number of shirt
70x + 30y = 810
30y = 810 - 70x
y = (810 - 70x)/30

When x is maximum, y will be minimum

For y to be minimum, (810 - 70x)/30 should be minimum

For a fraction to be minimum, numerator should be minimum and denominator should be maximum

Minimum value of (810 - 70x) is 810
Maximum value of 30 is 30

Minimum value of y = (810 - 70x)/30 = 810/30 = 27

Maximum number of trouser that can be purchased = 27

Ratio of trouser and shirt = 27/7 = 9

***********************************
ANSWER: Total distance 126 km
in an hour both Allen and Bob covered 126 km
that is 54 + 78 = 132
they meet for the first time Bob covered more KM than Allen . 78 - 54 = 24 .
so when they meet for the second time Bob covered 24 * 2 = 48 more km ( ANSWER E )
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the distance between X and Y be d km.

Time taken by Allen to travel from X to Y = d/54
Time taken by Bob to travel from Y to X = d/78
Time taken by Allen to travel from Y to X = d/54
Time taken by Bob to travel from X to Y = d/78

Total time taken by Allen and Bob to meet for the second time = d/54 + d/78 + d/54 + d/78 = 8d/132

Distance covered by Allen = 54 * 8d/132 = 28d/33
Distance covered by Bob = 78 * 8d/132 = 36d/33

Difference in distance covered by Allen and Bob = 36d/33 - 28d/33 = 8d/33 = 48 km

So the distance between X and Y is 48 km.

The answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Length of the rope = 20 meters .
Assume length of longer piece = x meters .
Length of shorter piece = x - 3
We know that x + x - 3 = 20
2 x = 23
Length of the longer piece = x = 11.5 meters
Correct Option : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        1. Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.
2. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3.
3. Since the total length of the rope is 20 meters, we have x + (x - 3) = 20.
4. Combining like terms, we get 2x - 3 = 20.
5. Adding 3 to both sides, we get 2x = 23.
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 11.5.
7. Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.
8. The answer is (D).

QUESTION: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $ 20 000 with terms 4 / 30 , n / 100 . What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount ?['A ) 247.67', 'B ) 237.67', 'C ) 227.67', 'D ) 215.67', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Explanation :
Suppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4 % of $ 20 000 = $ 800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice . He needs to borrow $ 20 000 = $ 800 = $ 19 200 . He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 ( the day the original invoice is due ) resulting in a 70 - day loan . The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $ 800 .
r = I / pt = 21.73 %
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73 % . This is a break - even rate . If he can borrow money , say at a rate of 15 % , he should do so . He would borrow $ 19 200 for 70 days at 15 % . Maturity value of the loan is $ 19 200 ( 1 + 0.15 ( 70 / 365 ) ) = $ 19 752.33
savings would be $ 20 000 − $ 19 752.33 = $ 247.67
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

        30/100 * 20000 = $6000 discount

6000/20000 * 100 = 30%

30/365 * 20000 = $15.67

So, the answer is (D).

QUESTION: You can purchase one soda and two energy bars for 150 cents , or two sodas and three energy bars for 300
cents . If the costs of the items do not change , compute the cost in cents of six sodas and seven bars .['A ) 500', 'B ) 600', 'C ) 750', 'D ) 800', 'E ) 900']
***********************************
ANSWER: The cost of adding one soda and one energy bar is 150 cents . We need to purchase six sodas and seven bars . We know two sodas and three bars costs 300 cents , so to that purchase , we ' d need to add four sodas and four bars - or four sets of items . So , we take the initial 300 + ( 4 * 150 ) = 300 + 600 = 900 .
Answer - E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1 soda + 2 bars = 150 cents
2 sodas + 3 bars = 300 cents

Let's say x is the cost of a soda and y is the cost of an energy bar.

1x + 2y = 150
2x + 3y = 300

Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:

x + y = 150

Substituting this value of x + y into the first equation, we get:

x = 150 - y

Substituting this value of x into the second equation, we get:

2(150 - y) + 3y = 300

300 - 2y + 3y = 300

5y = 0

y = 0

Substituting this value of y into the equation x = 150 - y, we get:

x = 150 - 0

x = 150

So, the cost of a soda is 150 cents and the cost of an energy bar is 0 cents.

The cost of 6 sodas and 7 energy bars is:

6(150) + 7(0) = 900 cents.

The answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let , the amount Mohan and Sohan receive be Rs . m and Rs . n , respectively . The amount that they receive 3 years and 2 years after should be equal .
⇒ m ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) 3 = n ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) 2
⇒ m ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) = n
⇒ m ( 26 / 25 ) = n
⇒ m / n = 25 / 26
Therefore , Rs . 5100 must be distribued in the ratio 25 : 26
So Mohan ' s share = 5100 × 25 / ( 25 + 26 ) = 2500
Answer B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Let's solve the 5th question:

A father wants to divide Rs. 5100 between his two sons, Mohan and Sohan who are 23 and 24 at present. He divides the amount in such a way that if their shares are invested at compound interest at 4% p.a. they will receive equal amount on attaining the age of 26 years. Find Mohan's share.

Let's say the share of Mohan is Rs. x. So, the share of Sohan is Rs. (5100 - x).

The amount invested at the time of division is Rs. x and Rs. (5100 - x). The time period is 26 - 23 = 3 years. The rate of interest is 4% p.a.

The amount of money that Mohan will receive after 3 years at the rate of 4% p.a. compound interest is given by:

A = P(26/23)3(4/100) = x(26/23)3(4/100)

The amount of money that Sohan will receive after 3 years at the rate of 4% p.a. compound interest is given by:

A = (5100 - x)(26/23)3(4/100)

Since Mohan and Sohan will receive equal amounts, we can equate the two equations:

x(26/23)3(4/100) = (5100 - x)(26/23)3(4/100)

On simplifying, we get:

x = 2500

Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2500.

***********************************
ANSWER: Coin is basically a cylinder .
So volume of coin T = pi r ^ 2 h = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 * 2
Coin = Silver + Aluminum
Now total volume of coin ( T ) = volume of silver + volume of aluminum
Also , volume of silver ( Vs ) = volume of aluminum ( Va )
T = Va + Vb
T = 2 Va
Va = T / 2 = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 * 2 / 2 = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2
Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum .
Let the weight of aluminum in coin be x
Weight of Silver = 2 x
Total weight of coin = 30
x + 2 x = 30
x = 10
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10 gm
Wright of Silver in coin is 20 gm .
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10 gm and volume is pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2
Now new Aluminum coin is made with dimension 1 x 30 mm .
Volume of this new coin = pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 .
Volume of pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 contains weight of 10 gm of aluminum
Volume of pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 will contain = 10 / pi ( 7.5 ) ^ * pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 = 40 gm
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Let's solve this question step-by-step.

1. The volume of the coin is 2 * 15 * 2 = 60 mm^3.

QUESTION: What is the largest integral value of ' k ' for which the quadratic equation x 2 - 5 x + k = 0 will have two real and distinct roots ?['A ) 9', 'B ) 7', 'C ) 3', 'D ) 8', 'E ) 12']
***********************************
ANSWER: Any quadratic equation will have real and distinct roots if the discriminant D > 0
The discriminant ' D ' of a quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 is given by b 2 - 4 ac
In this question , the value of D = 52 - 4 * 1 * k
If D > 0 , then 25 > 4 k or k < 6.2 .
Therefore , the highest integral value that k can take is 3 .
correct choice is ( C )
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The discriminant of the quadratic equation is b^2-4ac. In this case, b = -5, a = 1, and c = k. So the discriminant is (-5)^2-4*1*k = 25-4k. For the quadratic equation to have two real and distinct roots, the discriminant must be greater than or equal to 0. So 25-4k >= 0. Subtracting 25 from both sides, we get -4k >= -25. Dividing both sides by -4, we get k <= 6.25. Since k is an integer, the largest integral value of k is 6. The answer is (D).

***********************************
ANSWER: Let p = proportion that passed . Then 83 p + 55 ( 1 - p ) = 76 , so p = 21 / 28 = 75
correct answer E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Let's think step-by-step.

Let X be the number of students who passed and Y be the number of students who failed. Then X + Y = total number of students = 100.

The total marks scored by the students who passed is X * 83 = 83X. The total marks scored by the students who failed is Y * 55 = 55Y.

The total marks scored by the whole class is 83X + 55Y = 138X + 5500.

The overall class average is 138X + 5500 / 100 = 76.

138X + 5500 = 76 * 100 = 7600.

138X = 7600 - 5500 = 2100.

X = 2100 / 138 = 15.

The number of students who passed is 15.

The percentage of students who passed is 15 / 100 = 15 / 100 * 100 = 15 %.

***********************************
ANSWER: We have l = 9 and l + 2 b = 37
Area = ( l x b )
= ( 9 x 14 ) sq . ft
= 126 sq . ft .
Answer C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the length of the painted sides be x and y.
        So, x + y = 37
        And, x * y = 9 * 37 = 333
        So, x = 333/y
        Substituting in the equation x + y = 37, we get 333/y + y = 37
        So, y2 - 37y + 333 = 0
        So, y = 12 or 29
        Since, y cannot be negative, y = 12.
        So, x = 333/12 = 28
        So, the area of the parking space = 28 * 12 = 336 sq. ft.
        The answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: Total weight increased = ( 1.8 x 10 ) kg = 18 kg .
Weight of the new man = ( 53 + 18 ) kg = 71 kg .
ANSWER A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let the total weight of the 10 oarsmen be x kg.
        The average weight of the 10 oarsmen = x/10 = (x + 1.8)/11
        So, x = 11(x + 1.8) = 11x + 20.2
        11x - x = 20.2
        10x = 20.2
        x = 20.2/10 = 2.02
        The weight of the new man = (x + 1.8) = 2.02 + 1.8 = 3.82 kg.
        So, the answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: ( n - 1 ) C 2 = 45
n - 1 = 10
n = 11
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The total number of ways of selecting 2 balls is nC2 = n(n-1)/2
        The number of ways of selecting 2 balls excluding the ball marked 3 is (n-1)(n-2)/2
        Given that nC2 - (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45
        n(n-1)/2 - (n-1)(n-2)/2 = 45
        n(n-1) - (n-1)(n-2) = 90
        n^2 - n - n^2 + 2n = 90
        n^2 - 3n - 90 = 0
        n^2 - 10n + 7n - 90 = 0
        n(n-10) + 7(n-10) = 0
        (n-10)(n+7) = 0
        n = 10 or n = -7
        Since n cannot be negative, n = 10.
        The answer is (B).

Ans : 2 / 5 D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (B).

The number of integers from 1 to 1000 is 1000. The number of integers from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by 1000 is 1. So the number of integers from 1 to 1000 that are relatively prime to 1000 is 1000 - 1 = 999. The probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1000 is 999 / 1000 = 3 / 5.

Hence ( C ) is the correct answer
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        
        Let Joe's age be x, his sister's age be y, and his father's age be z. x + y + z = 100
        When Joe is as old as his father, x = z
        When Joe is as old as his father, y = 2y
        When Joe is as old as his father, z = 2(2y) = 4y
        x + y + z = 100
        x + 2y + 4y = 100
        7y = 100
        y = 100 / 7 = 14.28
        z = 4y = 4 * 14.28 = 57.12

***********************************
ANSWER: Number of choices for fruit = 6 , number of choices for vegetable = 8
The total number of combinations = 8 * 6 = 48
Answer C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        The answer is (A).

        There are 6 ways to choose a fruit for breakfast and 8 ways to choose a vegetable for dinner. So there are a total of 6 * 8 = 48 ways to choose a fruit and a vegetable for breakfast and dinner. However, since the man can only eat one type of fruit and one type of vegetable at a time, he cannot eat the same fruit and vegetable for both breakfast and dinner. This means that he has to choose a different fruit for breakfast and a different vegetable for dinner. So there are a total of 48 / 2 = 24 ways to eat breakfast and dinner.

QUESTION: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced . If the yard has an area of 240 square meters , how many meters of fencing does she need ?['A ) 58', 'B ) 62', 'C ) 66', 'D ) 70', 'E ) 74']
***********************************
ANSWER: The sides of the rectangle have a length of 10 and L .
The area is 10 * L = 240 so L = 24 .
She needs fencing with a length of 10 + 2 * 24 = 58 meters .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's think step-by-step.

Let's assume the length of the yard is l and the width is w. We know that l * w = 240. We also know that 2l + 2w = 3l = 70. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2(240 / w) + 2w = 70. Simplifying, we get 480 / w + 2w = 70. Combining like terms, we get 2w + 480 / w = 70. Subtracting 480 / w from both sides, we get 2w = 70 - 480 / w. Dividing both sides by 2, we get w = 35 - 240 / w. Substituting this back into the first equation, we get l = 240 / (35 - 240 / w). Simplifying, we get l = 10w - 60. Substituting this back into the equation 2l + 2w = 70, we get 2(10w - 60) + 2w = 70. Simplifying, we get 20w - 120 + 2w = 70. Combining like terms, we get 22w - 120 = 70. Adding 120 to both sides, we get 22w = 190. Dividing both sides by 22, we get w = 8.5. Substituting this back into the equation l = 10w - 60, we get l = 10(8.5) - 60 = 45. Therefore, the total length of fencing Alice needs is 4l = 4(45) = 180 meters. The answer is (E).

How many different codes can be made ?['A ) 1,980', 'B ) 2,020', 'C ) 2,100', 'D ) 2,200', 'E ) 1,900']
***********************************
ANSWER: There should be a vowel in the middle of the 3 - letter code , which means that 5 letters can be in the middle . Then , 20 letters can be placed in the first letter and 19 letters can be placed in the last letter as they should be different letters . Thus , 20 * 5 * 19 = 1,900 .
Therefore , the answer is E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (C).

        The number of ways to choose the middle letter is 5, because there are 5 vowels. The number of ways to choose the first letter and the third letter is 20 * 19 = 380, because there are 20 consonants and the first letter and the third letter must be different from each other. So the total number of ways to make the codes is 5 * 380 = 2,100.

***********************************
ANSWER: The addition of any 3 consecutive numbers is always divisible by 3
that rules out options a , b , c
Now focus on options 30 and 39
If we consider
12 , 13 , 14 the sum is 39
Answer = E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the three consecutive integers be x, x + 1, and x + 2. Then,

```
(x)(x + 1)(x + 2) = 727 + 728 + 729
```

Expanding the left-hand side, we get

```
x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x = 2204
```

Subtracting 2204 from both sides, we get

```
x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 2204 = 0
```

This is a cubic equation that can be solved using the quadratic formula. The solutions are

```
x = -14, -11, 13
```

Since we want the sum of three consecutive integers, we discard the negative solutions and choose x = 13. The sum of the three integers is then

```
13 + 14 + 15 = 42
```

The answer is (D).
