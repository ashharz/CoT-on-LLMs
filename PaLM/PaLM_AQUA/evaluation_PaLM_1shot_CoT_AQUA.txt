QUESTION: A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?['A ) 5 ( √ 3 + 1 )', 'B ) 6 ( √ 3 + √ 2 )', 'C ) 7 ( √ 3 – 1 )', 'D ) 8 ( √ 3 – 2 )', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Explanation :
Let the height of the building be h . Initially , he was at an angle of 450 . tan 45 = h / distance between car and tower . h = distance between car and tower ( since tan 45 = 1 ) .
Now , after 10 minutes , it travelled a certain distance , and angle changed to 600 .
tan 60 = h / x x = h / √ 3
So , in 10 minutes , it has travelled a distance of h – x = h - h / √ 3 .
10 minutes = h * ( 1 – 1 √ 3 )
h can be travelled in 10 / ( 1 – 1 √ 3 ) .
To travel a distance of x , which is h / √ 3 , it takes :
h = 10 / ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 )
h / √ 3 = 10 / √ 3 * ( 1 – 1 / √ 3 ) . Multiply numerator and denominator by 1 + √ 3 ( conjugate of 1 - √ 3 ) . We get , x = h / √ 3 = 10 ( 1 + √ 3 ) / 2 = 5 * ( 1 + √ 3 )
So , it takes 5 ( 1 + √ 3 ) minutes to reach the base of the tower .
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let the height of the tower be h m .
In ∆ ACB , tan 45° = h/x
In ∆ ADB , tan 60° = h/(x + 10)
⇒ x/h = 1/√3 and (x + 10)/h = √3/2
⇒ x/(x + 10) = 1/(√3/2) = 2/√3
⇒ 2x = √3(x + 10)
⇒ x = √3x/3 + 10√3/3
⇒ x = 5(√3 + 1)/3 m
∴ Required time = 5(√3 + 1)/3 × 18/5 = 10(√3 + 1) min

So, the final answer is A).

QUESTION: The original price of an item is discounted 22 % . A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $ 20 - off coupon . There is no tax on the item , and this was the only item the customer bought . If the customer paid $ 1.90 more than half the original price of the item , what was the original price of the item ?['A ) $ 61', 'B ) $ 65', 'C ) $ 67.40', 'D ) $ 70', 'E ) $ 78.20']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let x be the original price of the item
Discounted price = 0.78 x
Payment made by the customer after using the $ 20 coupon = 0.78 x - 20
0.78 x - 20 = x / 2 + 1.9
x = 78.20
Answer : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
The answer is: (D)

Let the original price be $x. So, the discounted price = $x - 22/100 * $x = $x * 78/100. The customer paid a total of $x * 78/100 - $20 = $x * 58/100. Therefore, $x * 58/100 = $x * 1/2 + $1.90. So, $x = $70.

What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur ?['A ) 0.22', 'B ) 0.26', 'C ) 0.37', 'D ) 0.46', 'E ) 0.63']
***********************************
ANSWER: The probability that stock A does not increase is 0.44 , and the probability that stock B does not increase is 0.26 . Now , how can the probability that both do not increase be more than individual probability of not increasing for each ? So the probability that both do not increase can not be more than 0.26 . Basically the probability that both do not increase is between 0 and 0.26 .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: 

1. The probability that both A and B will increase in value is (0.56)(0.74) = 0.4144
2. The probability that at least one of A or B will increase in value is 1 - (0.4144) = 0.5856
3. The probability that neither A nor B will increase in value is 1 - 0.5856 = 0.4144

So the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is 0.4144.

QUESTION: 20 marbles were pulled out of a bag of only white marbles , painted black , and then put back in . Then , another 20 marbles were pulled out , of which 1 was black , after which they were all returned to the bag . If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag , how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold ?['A ) 40', 'B ) 200', 'C ) 380', 'D ) 400', 'E ) 3200']
***********************************
ANSWER: We know that there are 20 black marbles in the bag and this number represent 1 / 20 th of the number of all marbles in the bag , thus there are total Q of 20 * 20 = 400 marbles .
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is D.

The first 20 marbles were painted black, so the bag now has 20 + 1 = 21 black marbles. The second 20 marbles were pulled out, of which 1 was black, so the bag now has 21 - 1 + 1 = 21 black marbles. Therefore, the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 21 / 40 = 0.525. Since the bag currently has 40 marbles, the total number of marbles in the bag is Q = 40 / 0.525 = 76.

***********************************
ANSWER: 450 * 12 ( x - 110 ) = 626400
where x is a selling cost of one item
x - 110 , is a profit from one item
450 - number of items produced and sold per month
12 - is a number of month in a year
Simplifying the equation will lead to x - 110 = 116 , then x = 230
B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is C).

Let's solve step-by-step.

First, we need to find the total number of components the company produces each year: 420 components / month * 12 months / year = 5040 components / year.

Then, we need to find the total cost of production for the company each year: 5040 components / year * $110 / component = $554,400 / year.

Then, we need to subtract the total cost of production from the desired profit to find the minimum selling price per component: $626,400 / year - $554,400 / year = $72,000 / year.

Then, we need to divide the minimum selling price per component by the number of components the company produces each year to find the minimum selling price per component: $72,000 / year / 5040 components / year = $14.40 / component.

Finally, we need to round the minimum selling price per component to the nearest dollar to find the final answer: $14.40 / component ≈ $14 / component.

QUESTION: Alex and Jacob works at a toy shop that make toys . Alex takes 7 hours to make a toy , and Jacob takes 9 hours to make a toy . During a month , both of them makes 35 toys in total . If both of them have worked for almost similar number of hours how many toys have been prepared by Jacob ?['A ) 15', 'B ) 16', 'C ) 17', 'D ) 18', 'E ) 19']
***********************************
ANSWER: Lets say Alex has worked for x hrs . , and Jacob has worked for y hrs . So , number of toys prepared by Alex is x / 7 , and Jacob is y / 9 . Since total number of toys prepared by both of them is 35 .
= > x / 7 + y / 9 = 35 .
= > 9 x + 7 y = ( 35 ) ( 63 )
= > 7 y = ( 35 ) ( 63 ) - 9 x
= > y = ( 5 ) ( 63 ) - ( 9 / 7 ) x
= > y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) x
= > x is to be a multiple of 7 . Also , we need to minimize the difference between x & y . Here are some possible values ,
x = 126 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 126 = 153
x = 133 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 133 = 144
x = 140 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 140 = 135
x = 147 , y = 315 - ( 9 / 7 ) 147 = 126
As we can see minimum difference between x and y is when x is 140 hrs . and y is 135 hrs . Thus total toys created by Jacob = y / 9 = 135 / 9 = 15 .
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let's say Alex worked for x hours and Jacob worked for y hours.

x + y = 35
7x + 9y = 35 * 16 = 560

7x = 560 - 9y
x = 78 - 9y/7

(78 - 9y/7) + y = 35

87 - 9y/7 = 35

QUESTION: John likes to have lightly flavored tea every evening . In a 50 % strong milk tea , he replaces 15 % of it with milk twice . Then , he replaces 10 percent of the resultant solution with more milk .
What is the final concentration of tea John drinks ?['A ) 15.38 %', 'B ) 42 %', 'C ) 39.86 %', 'D ) 22.35 %', 'E ) 32.51 %']
***********************************
ANSWER: Imagine starting out with 100 ml of 50 % milk tea .
In step 1 , 15 % of the tea is replaced with milk . Thus , 85 % of the original tea remains . Since this is done twice , we have a concentration of 50 x 0.85 x 0.85 % ( = 36.125 % ) of tea solution .
Finally , 10 % of this solution is replaced with milk again . So , the final concentration of tea is 36.125 * 0.9 %
This equals 32.51 % of tea solution .
Answer : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Step-by-step explanation:

Initial concentration of tea = 50 %
1st replacement of 15 % of 50 % tea with milk = 15/100 * 50 = 7.5 %
2nd replacement of 15 % of 42.5 % tea with milk = 15/100 * 42.5 = 6.375 %
Final concentration of tea = 50 - 7.5 - 6.375 - 10 = 22.35 %

So, the answer is D.

***********************************
ANSWER: Let the number be x
10 x + 1 = 3 ( 100,000 + x )
= > x = 42857 .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let the number be N = 10000*a + 1000*b + 100*c + 10*d + e

With a 1 before it, the number is 10001*a + 1001*b + 101*c + 11*d + e

With a 1 after it, the number is 10000*a + 1000*b + 100*c + 10*d + 1*e

Three times the number with a 1 before it is 3(10001*a + 1001*b + 101*c + 11*d + e)

Since the number with a 1 after it is three times the number with a 1 before it, we get:

10000*a + 1000*b + 100*c + 10*d + 1*e = 3(10001*a + 1001*b + 101*c + 11*d + e)

Rearranging, we get:

-2000*a - 200*b - 20*c - 2*d - e = 0

The only 5 digit number that satisfies this equation is 42857.

So, the answer is (A).

QUESTION: A hollow cube of size 5 cm is taken , with the thickness of 1 cm . It is made of smaller cubes of size 1 cm . If the outer surface of the cube is painted how many faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted ?['A ) 438', 'B ) 550', 'C ) 500', 'D ) 450', 'E ) 498']
***********************************
ANSWER: Volume of Big Cube considering it is not hollow = L 3 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125 cm 3
Size of hollow cube ( considering 1 cm thickness on two faces of large cube = 5 - 2 = 3 cm
Volume of hollow cube = 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 cm 3
So Total Volume filled up by smaller cubes = Volume of Larger Cube - Volume of hollow cube
= 125 - 27
= 98 cm 3
Volume of 1 small cube = 1 * 1 * 1 = 1 cm 3
Total number of small cubes in the larger cube = 98 / 1 = 98
and Number of faces of 98 small cubes ( 6 faces each cube has ) = 98 * 6 = 588 faces
Total Surface area of 6 faces of larger cube painted = 6 * L 2 = 6 * 5 * 5 = 150 cm 2
Surface area of one face of small cube = 1 * 1 = 1 cm 2
Number of faces of small cube painted = 150 / 1 = 150 faces
Hence number of faces of the smaller cubes remain unpainted = 588 - 150
= 438
answer . A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Chain-of-thought:

Outer surface area of hollow cube = 6 * 5 * 5 = 150 cm2
Outer surface area of 1 cm cube = 6 * 1 * 1 = 6 cm2
Number of 1 cm cubes = 150/6 = 25
Number of unpainted faces = 25 * 6 = 150

The answer should be B

***********************************
ANSWER: If 10 % of chocolates are cocoa flavored , then 90 % are vanilla flavored .
90 % of 90 % are squashed , i . e . 81 % are squashed .
Vanilla flavored and non squashed = 90 - 81 = 9 %
D is the answer
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let's say there are 100 chocolates. 10% of them are cocoa flavored, so 100 * 10 / 100 = 10 chocolates are cocoa flavored. So there are 100 - 10 = 90 chocolates that are not cocoa flavored. 90% of them are squashed, so 90 * 90 / 100 = 81 chocolates are squashed. So there are 90 - 81 = 9 chocolates that are not squashed. 10% of the chocolates are vanilla flavored and not squashed, so 9 * 10 / 100 = 9% of the chocolates are both vanilla flavored and not squashed.

QUESTION: Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books . She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters . If each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters , what is the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books ? ( Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter . )['A ) 3', 'B ) 4', 'C ) 5', 'D ) 10', 'E ) 20']
***********************************
ANSWER: The question asks for the smallest value of n , such that ( n + nC 2 ) = 10 ( n represents the number of letters . In this equation , n by itself is for single - letter codes and nC 2 is for two - letter codes ) .
At this point , you ' d need to pick numbers , since there ' s really no easy way to solve nC 2 = ( 10 – n ) without a calculator .
Looking at the answer choices , you can eliminate 10 and 20 , so you can quickly narrow down the values you need to test . ( i . e . ( 10 – n ) suggests n can not be less than 10 . )
As a general rule , whenever you ' re asked for the smallest value that satisfies a condition , start by testing the smallest number in the answers . Conversely , if you ' re asked for the largest value , start with the greatest answer .
Plug - in n = 4 to ( n + nC 2 ) = ( 4 + 4 C 2 ) = 4 + ( 4 x 3 / 2 ) = ( 4 + 6 ) = 10 ANS : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (B).

If Amy uses 1 letter to represent each type of book, she will need at least 10 letters. If Amy uses 2 letters to represent each type of book, she will need at least 10 / 2 = 5 letters. So the smallest number of letters Amy will need to create the codes for all 10 types of books is 5.

***********************************
ANSWER: Let its breadth be = x m .
So length will be = ( 4 x + 1 ) m .
Now ,
x * ( 4 x + 1 ) = 150
or , 4 x ^ 2 + x - 150 = 0
or , ( 4 x + 25 ) ( x - 6 ) = 0
Either 4 x = - 25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4 * 6 + 1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2 * ( 25 + 6 ) = 62 mLet its breadth be = x m .
So length will be = ( 4 x + 1 ) m .
Now ,
x * ( 4 x + 1 ) = 150
or , 4 x ^ 2 + x - 150 = 0
or , ( 4 x + 25 ) ( x - 6 ) = 0
Either 4 x = - 25 or x = 6
As breadth can not take negetive value so x = 6
So its length is 4 * 6 + 1 = 25
So perimeter will be 2 * ( 25 + 6 ) = 62 m
ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let the breadth be x m. Then, length = 4x + 1 m.

Area = (4x + 1)x = 150

4x2 + x = 150

4x2 + x - 150 = 0

(2x + 15)(2x - 10) = 0

2x + 15 = 0 or 2x - 10 = 0

x = -15/2 or x = 10/2

x = -7.5 or x = 5

Breadth = 5 m

Length = 4(5) + 1 = 21 m

Perimeter = 2(5 + 21) = 61 m

The answer is (B).

QUESTION: A ship went on a voyage . After it had traveled 180 miles a plane started with 10 times the speed of the ship . Find the distance when they meet from starting point .['A ) 238', 'B ) 289', 'C ) 200', 'D ) 287', 'E ) 187']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let the speed of the ship = m miles / hr . and plane took ' t ' hours to meet the ship
Then , m × t is the distance ship traveled after plane started
So we have , mt + 180 = 10 mt
⇒ 9 mt = 180
⇒ mt = 20
Hence distance = 180 + 20 = 200 miles
Answer : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Let's think step-by-step.

Let the speed of the ship be 's' miles/hr. Then, the speed of the plane = 10s miles/hr.

Distance traveled by the ship in 't' hours = 180 miles

Distance traveled by the plane in 't' hours = 10s * t miles

Total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane = 180 + 10s * t miles

Since the ship and the plane meet at the same point, their distance traveled is equal.

∴ 180 + 10s * t = 180

⇒ 10s * t = 0

⇒ t = 0

∴ The distance traveled by both the ship and the plane = 180 miles.


The final answer: C).

QUESTION: In a large forest , 300 deer were caught , tagged , and returned during 2001 . During 2002 , 500 deer were caught at random , of which only 20 had tags from the previous year . If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags , what is the total deer population in the forest ( assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002 ) ?['A ) 300', 'B ) 500', 'C ) 5000', 'D ) 6000', 'E ) 7500']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let N = the total number of deer in the forest .
During the first year , the percent of deer in the entire population with tags was : 300 / N
20 / 500 is the percent of deer caught during the second year that had tags . Since this sample percent matches the percent for the entire population ( i . e . , the total number of tagged deer divided by the total number of deer ) , the two ratios are equal .
Equating these two percents :
Sample = Population
( 20 / 500 ) = ( 300 / N )
N = ( 300 / 1 ) * ( 500 / 20 )
N = 7500

QUESTION: Boomtown urban planners expect the city ’ s population to increase by 10 % per year over the next two years . If that projection were to come true , the population two years from now would be exactly double the population of one year ago . Which of the following is closest to the percent population increase in Boomtown over the last year ?['A ) 20 %', 'B ) 40 %', 'C ) 50 %', 'D ) 65 %', 'E ) 75 %']
***********************************
ANSWER: Population now - 100 ;
Population one year from now - 110 ;
Population two years from now - 121 ;
Since the population two years from now ( 121 ) is exactly double the population one year ago then the population one year ago was 121 / 2 = 60.5 .
Now , the question asks about the population increase over the last year , so from 60.5 ( last year ) to 100 ( now ) : percent increase = difference / original * 100 = ( 100 - 60.5 ) / 60.5 * 100 = 39.5 / 60.5 * 100 = ~ 2 / 3 * 100 = ~ 65 % .
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: **Step-by-step explanation:**

Let's say the population of Boomtown one year ago is P. The population two years from now will be 2P. So, the population will increase by (2P - P) = P. The percent increase will be P / P * 100% = 100%. Since the population is expected to increase by 10% per year, the population increase over the last year is 10%.

***********************************
ANSWER: Suppose Arun has $ X and Sajal has $ Y . then ,
2 ( x - 30 ) = y + 30 = > 2 x - y = 90 … ( i )
and x + 10 = 3 ( y - 10 ) = > x - 3 y = - 40 … ( ii )
Solving ( i ) and ( ii ) , we get x = 62 and y = 34 .
Arun has $ 62 and Sajal has $ 34 .
Answer B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let the amount of money with Arjun = $x

Amount with Sajal = $y

After giving $30 to Sajal, Arjun has $x - $30 = $x - 30

After giving $10 to Arjun, Sajal has $y - $10 = $y - 10

Since Sajal has twice the amount of money left with Arjun,

$y - $10 = 2($x - $30)

$y = 2($x - $30) + $10

$y = 2$x - $60 + $10

$y = 2$x - $50

Since Arjun has thrice as much money as is left with Sajal,

$x = 3($y - $10)

$x = 3($y - $10)

$x = 3$y - $30

Equating 2$x - $50 = 3$y - $30, we get

$x = $62

$y = $35

So, Arjun has $62 and Sajal has $35.

***********************************
ANSWER: From the given data ,
abc – cba + 396 c = 990
100 a + 10 b + c – ( 100 c + 10 b + a ) + 396 c = 990
99 a – 99 c + 396 c = 990
Observe that each term is divisible by 99 . So on dividing the above expression by 99 , we get
a – c + 4 c = 10
a + 3 c = 10
For c = 1 , a = 7
c = 2 , a = 4
c = 3 , a = 1
' b ' can take any value from 0 to 9
We have to find the value of M more than 300 . So minimum value of ' a ' should be 4 .
So total possibilities are 402 , 412 , . . . . , 492 = 10 values
701 , 711 , . . . . . , 791 = 10 values
So total values = 20 .

MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let's say the fixed amount of the bill be Rs. x and the cost per call be Rs. y.

When 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs. 1800

540y + x = 1800

When 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs. 2040

620y + x = 2040

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get

80y = 240

y = 3

Plugging this value of y in the first equation, we get

540(3) + x = 1800

x = 1800 - 1620 = 180

So, the bill when 500 calls are made is

500(3) + 180 = 1680

The answer is (B).

QUESTION: Two balls A and B rotate along a circular track . Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes . Ball B makes 5 full rotation in 35 minutes . If they start rotating now from the same point , when will they be at the same starting point again ?['A ) 1 hour and 31 minutes', 'B ) 2 hour and 31 minutes', 'C ) 3 hour and 31 minutes', 'D ) 4 hour and 31 minutes', 'E ) 5 hour and 31 minutes']
***********************************
ANSWER: If ball A makes 2 rotations in 26 minutes , it makes 1 rotation in 13 minutes . If ball B makes 5 rotations in 35 minutes , it makes 1 rotation in 7 minutes .
The two balls start rotating now and makes several rotations before they are at the SAME starting points . Ball A would have done a WHOLE number X of rotations and ball B would have done a WHOLE number Y of rotations . Also they would have rotated during the same period of time T . Hence
T = 13 X = 7 Y
Hence 13 X = 7 Y
Solve the above for X
X = 7 Y / 13
We want the time when they are FIRST at the same starting point . Therefore X and Y are the smallest whole numbers of the equation X = 7 Y / 13 . The smallest value of Y that gives X as a whole number is 13 . Hence
X = 7 ( 13 ) / 13 = 7
Time T is given by
T = 13 X = 13 * 7 = 91 minutes = 1 hour and 31 minutes
correct answer A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (A).

We can find the time taken by ball A to complete one rotation by dividing the time taken to complete 2 rotations by 2: 26 minutes / 2 = 13 minutes. We can find the time taken by ball B to complete one rotation by dividing the time taken to complete 5 rotations by 5: 35 minutes / 5 = 7 minutes. Since the time taken by ball A to complete one rotation is less than the time taken by ball B to complete one rotation, ball A will reach the starting point first. Ball B will reach the starting point 13 minutes after ball A reaches the starting point. So, the total time taken by both balls to reach the starting point again is 13 minutes + 7 minutes = 20 minutes. Since 20 minutes is 1 hour and 40 minutes, the answer is (A).

***********************************
ANSWER: Starting from 1 Water Lilly it takes 60 days .
If there are already two present , it can be taken as the first day is over .
It will take 59 more days .
Notice that we are told thatthe number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days , thus if initially there were 64 water lilies instead of one , we can consider that 7 days are over and therefore only 53 days are left .
Answer : D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let's think step-by-step.

The number of water lilies on the lake doubles every 2 days, so the number of days required to double the number of water lilies is 2. The number of days required to triple the number of water lilies is 2 * 2 = 4. The number of days required to quadruple the number of water lilies is 2 * 2 * 2 = 8. The number of days required to quintuple the number of water lilies is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 16.

The number of water lilies on the lake doubles every 2 days, so the number of days required to quintuple the number of water lilies is 16. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. If initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, it will take 60 * 5 = 300 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.

QUESTION: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17 , and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109 . If we subtract 495 from the number , we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order . Find the number .['A ) 368', 'B ) 377', 'C ) 288', 'D ) 997', 'E ) 112']
***********************************
ANSWER: Sum of the squares should be equal to 109 . Only Options B and D satisfying . When we subtract 495 , only 863 becomes 368
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Let the digits be x,y and z. Then x + y + z = 17 and x2 + y2 + z2 = 109.

Also, 100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x

=> 99x - 99y = 495

=> 9(x - y) = 495

=> x - y = 55

Adding both equations, we get 2x + 2y + 2z = 17 + 55 = 72

=> x + y + z = 36

=> x = 36 - y - z

Substituting in first equation, we get 36 - y - z + y + z = 17

=> 36 = 17

=> y = z = 11

=> x = 36 - 11 - 11 = 14

The number is 1431.

So, the answer is A.

40 grams of mixture 1 contains 6 * 40 / 15 = 16 grams of zinc and 24 grams of copper
60 grams of mixture 2 contains 7 * 60 / 18 = 77 / 3 grams of zinc and 110 / 3 grams of copper
Thus , ratio = ( 16 + 77 / 3 ) / ( 24 + 110 / 3 ) = 59 / 91
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

In alloy X , 6 parts are zinc and 9 parts are copper . So , 6 + 9 = 15 parts are present in alloy X .

In alloy Y , 7 parts are zinc and 11 parts are copper . So , 7 + 11 = 18 parts are present in alloy Y .

Total parts in alloy X and Y = 15 + 18 = 33 parts .

Total zinc in alloy X and Y = 6 + 7 = 13 parts .

Total copper in alloy X and Y = 9 + 11 = 20 parts .

∴ Required ratio = 13 : 20 = 59 : 90

***********************************
ANSWER: Here x = 1.5 must satisfy the equation
= > 1.5 ^ 2 + 1.5 m + 22 = 0
= > m = - 16.2
ANSWER : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Step-by-step explanation:

Let's solve the quadratic equation.

```
x^2 + mx + 22 = 0

(-m + sqrt(m^2 - 4*22))/2 = 1.5

(-m + sqrt(m^2 - 92))/2 = 1.5

-m + sqrt(m^2 - 92) = 3

m^2 - 92 = 9 - 2m

m^2 - 2m - 83 = 0

(m + 11)(m - 7) = 0

m = -11 or 7

Since m is a coefficient of x^2, it cannot be negative. So m = 7.

***********************************
ANSWER: The two ants move a total of 15 cm per hour .
The time it takes until they meet is 75 / 15 = 5 hours .
In that time , the distance that ant A travels is 5 * 9 = 45 cm .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (C).

Let's solve step-by-step.

The total distance traveled by both ants is 75 cm. Since they are moving towards each other, the distance traveled by ant A is 75 / 2 = 37.5 cm.

The speed of ant A is 9 cm / hour. So, the time taken by ant A to travel 37.5 cm is 37.5 / 9 = 4.22 hours.

QUESTION: A man spend 810 in buying trouser at Rs 70 each and shirt at 30 each . What will be the ratio of trouser and shirt when the maximum number of trouser is purchased ?['A ) 9 Trousers', 'B ) 8 Trousers', 'C ) 10 Trousers', 'D ) 7 Trousers', 'E ) 11 Trousers']
***********************************
ANSWER: Lets assume S as price of shirt and T as price of trousers , we have bellow equation :
70 T + 30 S = 810
Simplifying we get : 7 T + 3 S = 81
T = ( 81 - 3 * S ) / 7
We need to find the least value of S which will make ( 81 - 3 * S ) divisible by 7
Simplifying by taking 3 as common factor 3 * ( 27 - S ) / 7
Looking at the above equation its not difficult to find out least value of S is 6 so that 27 - 3 S becomes divisible by S
Hence , T = ( 81 - 3 * S ) / 7 = ( 81 - 3 * 6 ) / 7 = 63 / 7 = 9
ANSWER : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
Let's say that x is the number of trousers purchased. Then, the number of shirts purchased is 810 - 70x. The total cost of the trousers is 70x and the total cost of the shirts is 30(810 - 70x). So, 70x + 30(810 - 70x) = 810. Simplifying, we get 10x = 810. Thus, x = 81. So, the maximum number of trousers purchased is 81. The ratio of trousers and shirts is 81:(810 - 70*81) = 81:10. So, the answer is (C).

QUESTION: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets . They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads , Christopher will give $ 2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails , Jonathan will give 3 $ to Christopher . After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount .
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?['A ) 10', 'B ) 23', 'C ) 16', 'D ) 18', 'E ) 12']
***********************************
ANSWER: The amount won and lost by both is equal .
Thus 2 x = 3 ( 20 - x ) - - - x in the number of times heads came
X = 12
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let's think step-by-step.

If the coin landed on heads 10 times , Christopher would have given 10 * 2 = $20 to Jonathan . And if the coin landed on tails 10 times , Jonathan would have given 10 * 3 = $30 to Christopher . So the total amount that Christopher would have given to Jonathan is 20 + 30 = $50 . Since Christopher neither won nor lost any amount , he would have given exactly 50 / 2 = $25 to Jonathan each time the coin landed on heads . So the coin landed on heads 25 / 2 = 12 times .

QUESTION: Allen starts from X , goes to Y . At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X . Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X . Once Bob reaches X , he changes his direction and returns to Y . Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78 kmph . By the time they meet for the second time , Bob covers 48 km more than Allen . Find the distance between X and Y .['A ) 144 km', 'B ) 72 km', 'C ) 126 km', 'D ) 84 km', 'E ) 48 km']
***********************************
ANSWER: Total distance 126 km
in an hour both Allen and Bob covered 126 km
that is 54 + 78 = 132
they meet for the first time Bob covered more KM than Allen . 78 - 54 = 24 .
so when they meet for the second time Bob covered 24 * 2 = 48 more km ( ANSWER E )
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let the distance between X and Y be d km.

Time taken by Allen to go from X to Y = d/54
Time taken by Allen to go from Y to X = d/54
Total time taken by Allen = d/54 + d/54 = d/27
Time taken by Bob to go from Y to X = d/78
Time taken by Bob to go from X to Y = d/78
Total time taken by Bob = d/78 + d/78 = d/39

Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, we have d/39 - d/27 = 48
(d/39 + d/27) = 48 + d/27
2d/27 = 48 + d/27
2d = 48(27) + d
d = 48(27)/3 = 48(9) = 432 km.

So the answer is (C).

***********************************
ANSWER: Average cost of new tire = $ 45 / tire
cost of repairing the current tire = $ 40 / tire
new tire is $ 5 more per tire .
i e . 5 / 40 = 1 / 8 = 12.5 %
ANSWER : C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Step-by-step solution:
The cost of a new tire for 4 years = $180
The cost of repairing a current tire for 5 years = $40 * 5 = $200
The average cost per year of the new tires = $180 / 4 = $45
The average cost per year of repairing the current tires = $200 / 5 = $40
The difference in cost per year = $45 - $40 = $5
The percentage increase = $5 / $40 * 100% = 12.5%
The answer is C.

QUESTION: A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $ 20 000 with terms 4 / 30 , n / 100 . What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount ?['A ) 247.67', 'B ) 237.67', 'C ) 227.67', 'D ) 215.67', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Explanation :
Suppose the merchant will take advantage of the cash discount of 4 % of $ 20 000 = $ 800 by paying the bill within 30 days from the date of invoice . He needs to borrow $ 20 000 = $ 800 = $ 19 200 . He would borrow this money on day 30 and repay it on day 100 ( the day the original invoice is due ) resulting in a 70 - day loan . The interest he should be willing to pay on borrowed money should not exceed the cash discount $ 800 .
r = I / pt = 21.73 %
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is 21.73 % . This is a break - even rate . If he can borrow money , say at a rate of 15 % , he should do so . He would borrow $ 19 200 for 70 days at 15 % . Maturity value of the loan is $ 19 200 ( 1 + 0.15 ( 70 / 365 ) ) = $ 19 752.33
savings would be $ 20 000 − $ 19 752.33 = $ 247.67
Answer : A
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (D).

Let's do the math.

The discount is 20000 * 4 / 30 = $266.67.

The time is 100 - 30 = 70 days.

The simple interest is 266.67 * 70 / 20000 = 8.767%.

The highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount is 8.767%.

***********************************
ANSWER: The cost of adding one soda and one energy bar is 150 cents . We need to purchase six sodas and seven bars . We know two sodas and three bars costs 300 cents , so to that purchase , we ' d need to add four sodas and four bars - or four sets of items . So , we take the initial 300 + ( 4 * 150 ) = 300 + 600 = 900 .
Answer - E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

1 soda + 2 energy bars = 150 cents
2 sodas + 3 energy bars = 300 cents

2 sodas = 300 - 150 = 150 cents
1 energy bar = (150 - 100) / 2 = 25 cents

6 sodas + 7 energy bars = 6 * 150 + 7 * 25 = 900 cents

QUESTION: A pen company produces very fine quality of writing pens . Company knows that on average 10 % of the produced pens are always defective so are rejected before packing . Company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs . 10 each . It estimates the overall profit on all the manufactured pens to be 25 % . What is the manufactured cost of each pen ?['A ) Rs . 6', 'B ) Rs . 7.2', 'C ) Rs . 5.6', 'D ) Rs . 8', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: The company is able to deliver 90 % of the manufactured pens . Means to produce 7200 pens they must have to produce 8000 pens as 10 % are defectives . So , let K be the manufacturing price of each pen .
Total income ( including 25 % profit ) = 8000 * K * 1.25
This same income is obtained by selling 90 % manufactured pens at Rs . 10 which is equal to 7200 * 10 .
Thus ,
8000 * K * 1.25 = 7200 * 10
K = Rs . 7.2 . [ 90 % of 8000 = 7200 ]
Answer : Option B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let the cost price of each pen be Rs. x
Total cost price of 7200 pens = 7200x
Total selling price of 7200 pens = 7200 * 10 = 72000
Total profit = 72000 - 7200x = 72000 - 72000(100/125) = 6000
∴ x = 6000/7200 = 8

2 x + 2 y - 2 ≤ L ( x , y ) ≤ 2 x + 2 y
= > a – 2 ≤ R ≤ a
Therefore , L ≤ R .
Answer : D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let x and y be two positive real numbers.

Since [x] + [y] + [x + y] is the sum of three integers, it must be an integer.

Since [2x] + [2y] is the sum of two integers, it must be an integer.

Since [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y], these two integers must be the same.

Therefore, L(x, y) = R(x, y).

The answer is (A).

***********************************
ANSWER: 20 x 60 = 10 x S 2
S 2 = 120 kmph
Answer : Option C
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The answer is (C).

The formula for speed is:

Speed = Distance / Time

So, the speed of the car in the first case is:

60 km / hr = Distance / 20 hours

Distance = 60 * 20 = 1200 km

The speed of the car in the second case is:

Speed = Distance / Time

Speed = 1200 km / 10 hours = 120 km / hr

The speed gain is:

120 km / hr - 60 km / hr = 60 km / hr

So, the answer is (C).

Find Mohan ' s share .['A ) 2400', 'B ) 2500', 'C ) 2600', 'D ) 2700', 'E ) None of these']
***********************************
ANSWER: Let , the amount Mohan and Sohan receive be Rs . m and Rs . n , respectively . The amount that they receive 3 years and 2 years after should be equal .
⇒ m ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) 3 = n ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) 2
⇒ m ( 1 + 4 / 100 ) = n
⇒ m ( 26 / 25 ) = n
⇒ m / n = 25 / 26
Therefore , Rs . 5100 must be distribued in the ratio 25 : 26
So Mohan ' s share = 5100 × 25 / ( 25 + 26 ) = 2500
Answer B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let the shares of Mohan and Sohan be Rs. x and Rs. (5100 - x) respectively.

***********************************
ANSWER: Coin is basically a cylinder .
So volume of coin T = pi r ^ 2 h = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 * 2
Coin = Silver + Aluminum
Now total volume of coin ( T ) = volume of silver + volume of aluminum
Also , volume of silver ( Vs ) = volume of aluminum ( Va )
T = Va + Vb
T = 2 Va
Va = T / 2 = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 * 2 / 2 = pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2
Silver is twice as heavy as aluminum .
Let the weight of aluminum in coin be x
Weight of Silver = 2 x
Total weight of coin = 30
x + 2 x = 30
x = 10
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10 gm
Wright of Silver in coin is 20 gm .
Weight of Aluminum in coin is 10 gm and volume is pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2
Now new Aluminum coin is made with dimension 1 x 30 mm .
Volume of this new coin = pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 .
Volume of pi ( 7.5 ) ^ 2 contains weight of 10 gm of aluminum
Volume of pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 will contain = 10 / pi ( 7.5 ) ^ * pi ( 15 ) ^ 2 * 1 = 40 gm

***********************************
ANSWER: Any quadratic equation will have real and distinct roots if the discriminant D > 0
The discriminant ' D ' of a quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0 is given by b 2 - 4 ac
In this question , the value of D = 52 - 4 * 1 * k
If D > 0 , then 25 > 4 k or k < 6.2 .
Therefore , the highest integral value that k can take is 3 .
correct choice is ( C )
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (B) 7.

The quadratic equation x 2 - 5 x + k = 0 has two real and distinct roots if its discriminant D = b 2 - 4ac > 0.

In this case, b = -5, a = 1, and c = k. So, D = (-5) 2 - 4(1)(k) = 25 - 4k > 0.

For D to be positive, 25 - 4k > 0.

Therefore, 4k < 25.

This means that k < 25 / 4 = 6.25.

The largest integral value of k that is less than 6.25 is 7.

Therefore, the answer is (B) 7.

***********************************
ANSWER: The amount remaining after each feeding session is 2 / 3 of what was in the bowl .
There were four feeding sessions .
The amount remaining just before noon was ( 2 / 3 ) ^ 4 = 16 / 81 , which is about 20 % .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is B.

Let's say the original amount of food in the bowl was 100%. At 9:00 am, the dog ate 1 / 3 of the food, leaving 100% - 1 / 3 = 2 / 3 of the food remaining. At 10:00 am, the dog ate 1 / 3 of the food remaining, leaving 2 / 3 - 1 / 3 = 1 / 3 of the food remaining. At 11:00 am, the dog ate 1 / 3 of the food remaining, leaving 1 / 3 - 1 / 3 = 0 of the food remaining.

So, the dog ate 100% - 0% = 100% of the food in the bowl. This means that 100% * 25% = 25% of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day.

QUESTION: If Q , a positive integer , has 5 factors , which of the following must be true about Q ?
I . Q is the square of a prime number .
II . Q is the fourth power of a prime number .
III . Q is the product of two prime numbers .['A ) I only', 'B ) III only', 'C ) II only', 'D ) I and II only', 'E ) I and III only']
***********************************
ANSWER: If Q has 5 factors , we can represent Q = a ^ 4 , where a is positive integer more than 1 . Let ' s assume that ` ` a ' ' is not a prime number . Let a = kp , where both k and p are positive integers .
Thus , Q = ( kp ) 4 = k 4 ∗ p 4 ( kp ) 4 = k 4 ∗ p 4 . Now the number of factors of Q = ( 4 + 1 ) * ( 4 + 1 ) = 25 . But as the given condition states that Q has ONLY 5 factors , thus ` ` a ' ' ca n ' t have any other factor except 1 and itself . Thus , a = prime number .
Statement I : We can represent Q = ( a ^ 2 ) ^ 2 . Thus , we have to prove whether a ^ 2 is a prime number . Take a = 2 . We can see that it is not a prime number . Thus , this option ca n ' t answer a ` ` MUST be true question ' '
Statement II : Always true as proved above .
Statement III : Again take a = 2 . Thus , Q = 64 . We do n ' t have this as product of 2 primes .
The Answer is , B .
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Given that Q has 5 factors, it can be expressed as Q = p1*p2*p3*p4*p5 where p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5 are prime numbers.

(i) Q is the square of a prime number. If p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = p5, then Q = p1^5 = (p1^2)^2. Hence, Q is the square of a prime number.

(ii) Q is the fourth power of a prime number. If p1 = p2 = p3 = p4 = p5, then Q = p1^5 = (p1^4)^2. Hence, Q is the fourth power of a prime number.

(iii) Q is the product of two prime numbers. If p1 ≠ p2 ≠ p3 ≠ p4 ≠ p5, then Q = p1*p2*p3*p4*p5. Hence, Q is the product of two prime numbers.

Therefore, the answer is (E).

***********************************
ANSWER: Jack did 2 / 3 of the work , which is 8 hours . So if Jack would finish the job this would take him 4 extra hours . Jill ' s rate is 5 % of what Jack would do in those 4 hours . That means it would take her ten times as much time as Jack put into the job . 5 * 4 equals 20 , answer E .
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (C).

Two - thirds of the work is done by Jack in 12 hours . So , 1 / 3rd of the work is done by Jill in 12 * ( 1 / 2 ) = 8 hours.

Jill 's rate of cleaning is 5 % of Jack 's rate of cleaning . So , Jill can clean the entire yacht in 12 * ( 100 / 5 ) = 240 hours.

Therefore , Jill takes 240 - 8 = 22 hours to clean the remaining work.

( Two groups of presenters are considered different if at least one presenter is different . )['A ) 120', 'B ) 19', 'C ) 180', 'D ) 420', 'E ) 460']
***********************************
ANSWER: No of ways = All ways to choose - ways using just men - ways using just women = C ( 8,4 ) - C ( 4,4 ) - C ( 4,4 ) = 21 - 1 - 1 = 19
Answer is ( B )
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is (C).

We can choose 4 presenters from 4 men and 4 women in 4C4 * 4C4 = 4! / (4! * 0!) * 4! / (4! * 0!) = 4 * 4 = 16 ways.

We can choose 3 men and 1 woman in 4C3 * 4C1 = 4! / (3! * 1!) * 4! / (3! * 1!) = 4 * 4 = 16 ways.

We can choose 2 men and 2 women in 4C2 * 4C2 = 4! / (2! * 2!) * 4! / (2! * 2!) = 6 * 6 = 36 ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways in which 4 presenters can be chosen from the team is 16 + 16 + 36 = 68.

However, we have to exclude the cases where the team is composed of men only or women only. There are 4 ways to choose 4 men from the team and 4 ways to choose 4 women from the team. So, the number of ways in which the team is composed of men only or women only is 4 + 4 = 8.

Therefore, the number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen from the team if a team cannot be composed of men only or women only is 68 - 8 = 60.

What is the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 ?['A ) 5 / 7', 'B ) 3 / 5', 'C ) 4 / 7', 'D ) 2 / 5', 'E ) 2 / 7']
***********************************
ANSWER: We need all numbers between 1 and 1000 that are co - prime .
Between 1 to 10 there are 4 : 1,3 , 7,9
Take the period of 10 ' s , we have 100 periods of 10 ' s between 1 to 1000
So the total number of co - primes = 400
Now , the simple part . . .
Probability = 400 / 1000 ( i . e picking a co - prime from the first 1000 numbers )
Ans : 2 / 5 D
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is D.

The number 1000 is divisible by 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, and 200. So the number of numbers in S that are divisible by 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100, and 200 is 9.

The number of numbers in S that are relatively prime to 1,000 is 1000 - 9 = 991.

So the probability that a number chosen from S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 991 / 1000 = 2 / 5.

QUESTION: At the of his one - year investment , Charles received $ 54,080 , including interest and principal from a certain investment . If the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi - annually , which of the following is the amount of money that Charles originally invested ?['A ) $ 45,000', 'B ) $ 50,000', 'C ) $ 54,000', 'D ) $ 59,000', 'E ) $ 62,000']
***********************************
ANSWER: You are given that a certain investment gave you X $ after 1 year . So the original investment must be < X
Thus you can rule out options D - E as these options will make the original amount > the interest + principle amount
Option C is very close to the amount after 1 st year and 4 % will definitely give you > 80 $ in interests .
Now you only have 2 options left ( A and B )
Per the question , let x be the original amount invested - - - > x ( 1.04 ) ^ 2 = 54080 .
This clearly shows that answer must be B .
ANSWER : B
 .Correct Answer is B
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Let P be the principal amount invested by Charles.

A = P(1 + 8/100)^2 = 54080

P = 54080/(1 + 8/100)^2 = $50,000.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. We are given that the amount of money Charles received at the end of one year is $54,080.
2. We are also given that the investment paid an annual interest of 8 percent compounded semi-annually.
3. We can use the following formula to calculate the amount of money Charles originally invested:

```
A = P(1 + r/n)^nt
```

where

* A is the final amount of money
* P is the principal amount invested
* r is the annual interest rate
* n is the number of times per year interest is compounded
* t is the number of years the money is invested for

4. In this case, we have

* A = $54,080
* P = ?
* r = 8%
* n = 2
* t = 1

5. Substituting these values into the formula, we get

```
$54,080 = P(1 + 8/100)^2
```

6. Simplifying, we get

```
$54,080 = P(1.04)^2
```

7. Multiplying both sides by 1/(1.04)^2, we get

```
P = $54,080/(1.04)^2 = $50,000
```

8. Therefore, the amount of money Charles originally invested is $50,000.

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father . Find the age of Joe ' s father ?['A ) 45', 'B ) 48', 'C ) 50', 'D ) 55', 'E ) 58']
***********************************
ANSWER: Joe + Sister + Father = 100
After x years joe age is equal to his father
Joe + x = father
Therefore , Sister + x = 2 * Sister
= > Sister = x
Joe + Sister = Father
Therefore ,
= > 2 * Father = 100
= > Father = 50
Hence ( C ) is the correct answer
 .Correct Answer is C
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let Joe's age be x, Joe's sister's age be y and Joe's father's age be z.

x + y + z = 100

When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister's age = 2y

When Joe is as old as his father, his father's age = 2z

When Joe's sister was as old as her father, her age = z

2y + 2z = 100

z = 50

So, the answer is C.

QUESTION: If m > 0 , y > 0 , and x is m percent of 4 y , then , in terms of y , m is what percentage of x ?['A ) y / 400', 'B ) 4 y', 'C ) 50 y', 'D ) 2500 / y', 'E ) 5000 / y']
***********************************
ANSWER: x = ( m / 100 ) * 4 y
m = 100 x / 4 y = 25 x / y
m is ( 2500 / y ) % of x .
The answer is D .
 .Correct Answer is D
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Chain-of-thought:

Let's assume that x = m% of 4y. That means x = (m/100)*4y.

Rearranging the equation, we get m = (100x/4y).

To find m% of x, we need to multiply m by 100 and divide by x.

So, m% of x = (100m/4y)*(x/x) = (100m/4y).

Therefore, m% of x = (100m/4y) = (5000/y).

The answer is (E).

QUESTION: There is a 90 % chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election . If five registered voters are chosen at random , what is the approximate likelihood that exactly four of them voted in the last election ?['A ) 26.2 %', 'B ) 32.8 %', 'C ) 43.7 %', 'D ) 59.0 %', 'E ) 65.6 %']
***********************************
ANSWER: The probability that four of five voted is :
P ( 1 st one voted ) X . . . X P ( 4 th one voted ) X ( 5 th one NOT voted )
= 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.1
= 0.81 x 0.81 x 0.1 = 0.6561
ANSWER : E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The answer is C).

Let P(A) be the probability that a registered voter voted in the last election. Let X be the random variable representing the number of registered voters who voted in the last election. We want to find P(X = 4).

We know that P(A) = 0.9 and P(A') = 1 - P(A) = 0.1.

We can use the binomial distribution to find P(X = 4). The binomial distribution is a probability distribution that describes the number of successes in a sequence of independent experiments, each of which has a constant probability of success. In this case, the experiments are the registered voters being chosen at random, and the success is the voter having voted in the last election.

The formula for the binomial distribution is:

P(X = x) = (n! / x!(n - x)!) * p^x * (1 - p)^(n - x)

where n is the number of experiments, x is the number of successes, p is the probability of success, and (n! / x!(n - x)!) is the binomial coefficient.

In this case, n = 5, x = 4, p = 0.9, and (n! / x!(n - x)!) = 5! / 4!(5 - 4)! = 5.

So, P(X = 4) = (5! / 4!(5 - 4)!) * 0.9^4 * (0.1)^(5 - 4) = 5 * 0.9^4 * 0.1^1 = 43.7%.

Therefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five registered voters voted in the last election is 43.7%.

QUESTION: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced . If the yard has an area of 240 square meters , how many meters of fencing does she need ?['A ) 58', 'B ) 62', 'C ) 66', 'D ) 70', 'E ) 74']
***********************************
ANSWER: The sides of the rectangle have a length of 10 and L .
The area is 10 * L = 240 so L = 24 .
She needs fencing with a length of 10 + 2 * 24 = 58 meters .
The answer is A .
 .Correct Answer is A
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Let the length of the yard be x . Then the width of the yard is 240/x . Since one side is left unfenced , the length of the fencing required is 3x + 240/x - 10 = 3x + 230/x . The area of the yard is (x * 240/x ) = 240 . So x^2 = 240 * x . So x = 240^(1/2) = 15.49 . So the length of the fencing required is 3 * 15.49 + 230/15.49 - 10 = 74 meters .

The answer: E.

***********************************
ANSWER: The addition of any 3 consecutive numbers is always divisible by 3
that rules out options a , b , c
Now focus on options 30 and 39
If we consider
12 , 13 , 14 the sum is 39
Answer = E
 .Correct Answer is E
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Chain-of-thought:

The product of three consecutive integers is (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) = x3 + 6x2 + 11x + 6.

727 + 728 + 729 = 2204

2204 = x3 + 6x2 + 11x + 6

x3 + 6x2 + 11x - 2200 = 0

(x + 20)(x + 28)(x - 10) = 0

x = 10, -28, -20

The sum of three consecutive integers is 10 + 11 + 12 = 33.

The answer should be E.
