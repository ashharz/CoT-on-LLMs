***********************************
ANSWER: ( 17.0 - 15.0 )=2
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. First find the total number of flowers before Jessica cut some: 15 roses + 62 orchids = 77 flowers.
2. Then find the total number of flowers after Jessica cut some: 17 roses + 96 orchids = 113 flowers.
3. Subtract the number of flowers before Jessica cut some from the number of flowers after she cut some to find the number of flowers she cut: 113 flowers - 77 flowers = 36 flowers.
4. Then subtract the number of orchids Jessica cut from the total number of flowers she cut to find the number of roses she cut: 36 flowers - 96 orchids = -60 roses.
5. Since the number of roses Jessica cut cannot be negative, we can conclude that she cut 60 roses.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase before Jessica cut some, for a total of 15 roses + 62 orchids = 77 flowers.
2. After Jessica cut some flowers, there were 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase, for a total of 17 roses + 96 orchids = 113 flowers.
3. To find the number of flowers Jessica cut, we subtract the number of flowers before she cut some from the number of flowers after she cut some: 113 flowers - 77 flowers = 36 flowers.
4. To find the number of roses Jessica cut, we subtract the number of orchids Jessica cut from the total number of flowers she cut: 36 flowers - 96 orchids = -60 roses.
5. Since the number of roses Jessica cut cannot be negative, we can conclude that she cut 60 roses.

QUESTION: Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a dayHow many days would the soda bottles last?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 360.0 / 9.0 )=40

MODEL's_ANSWER: Step-by-step solution:
        1. First find the total number of bottles that Debby drank in one day: 122 water bottles + 9 soda bottles = 131 bottles.
        2. Then divide the number of soda bottles that Debby bought by the number of bottles that she drinks in one day to find how many days the soda bottles will last: 360 soda bottles / 131 bottles / day = 2.73 days.
        3. Finally, round the answer to the nearest whole number to find that the soda bottles will last 2 days.
