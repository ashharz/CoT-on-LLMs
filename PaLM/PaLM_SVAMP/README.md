# Hereby the experimental results ( codes as well as output) on SVAMP data set is included.
## File Naming Convension:
**REORD_PaLM_{number of exemplars}shot_CoT_SVAMP.txt**: For CoT prompts with incomplete reasoning as well as reordered the inputs prompt with ascending order of their complexity( If a question's answer consists of more line of reasoning than other, then we say this question is complex than other).


**HOC_PaLM_{number of exemplars}shot_CoT_SVAMP.txt**: For CoT prompts with incomplete reasoning( erased final step of calculation).
