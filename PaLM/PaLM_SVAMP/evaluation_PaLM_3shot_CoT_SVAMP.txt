QUESTION: In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girlsHow many pupils are there in that school?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 692.0 + 692.0 ) - 458.0 )=926
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:
        Let's say the number of boys is x. Then the number of girls is x + 458. We know that the total number of pupils is x + x + 458 = 2x + 458. We also know that the total number of pupils is 692. So 2x + 458 = 692. Subtracting 458 from both sides, we get 2x = 234. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 117. So there are 117 boys in the school. The total number of pupils is 117 + 692 = 809.

The answer: 809

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Step-by-step solution:

After that, there were 12 children on the bus. So some children got on the bus and there were 12 + 32 = 44 children on the bus after some children got on. So 44 - 12 = 32 children got on the bus. So 68 - 32 = 36 more children got off the bus than those that got on.
