QUESTION: There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left.How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 49.0 - 3.0 )=46
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Olivia had 3 dollars in her wallet.
2. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm, for a total of 3 + 49 = 52 dollars.
3. After visiting the supermarket, she had 49 dollars left.
4. Therefore, she spent 52 - 49 = 3 dollars at the supermarket.
5. Since she collected 49 dollars at the atm and spent 3 dollars at the supermarket, she collected 49 - 3 = 46 more dollars at the atm than she spent at the supermarket.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. First, we need to find the total amount of money Olivia had in her wallet before she collected more money from the atm. We know that she had 3 dollars in her wallet, so we can write:

```
Total amount of money in Olivia's wallet before collecting more money from the atm = 3 dollars
```

2. Next, we need to find the total amount of money Olivia had in her wallet after she collected more money from the atm. We know that she collected 49 more dollars from the atm, so we can write:

```
Total amount of money in Olivia's wallet after collecting more money from the atm = 3 dollars + 49 dollars = 52 dollars
```

3. Now, we need to find the amount of money Olivia had left after visiting the supermarket. We know that she had 49 dollars left after visiting the supermarket, so we can write:

```
Amount of money Olivia had left after visiting the supermarket = 49 dollars
```

4. Next, we need to find the amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket. We know that she had 52 dollars after collecting more money from the atm and 49 dollars left after visiting the supermarket, so we can write:

```
Amount of money Olivia spent at the supermarket = 52 dollars - 49 dollars = 3 dollars
```

5. Finally, we need to find the amount of money Olivia collected at the atm that was more than she spent at the supermarket. We know that she collected 49 dollars at the atm and spent 3 dollars at the supermarket, so we can write:

```
Amount of money Olivia collected at the atm that was more than she spent at the supermarket = 49 dollars - 3 dollars = 46 dollars
```

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 6.0 - ( 3.0 + 2.0 ) )=1
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

There were originally 3 birds on the fence. 2 more birds came to join them, so there are now 3 + 2 = 5 birds on the fence. 6 more storks came to join them, so there are now 6 + 5 = 11 storks and birds on the fence. There are 11 - 5 = 6 more storks than birds on the fence.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. There were originally 3 birds on the fence.
2. 2 more birds came to join them, so there are now 3 + 2 = 5 birds on the fence.
3. 6 more storks came to join them, so there are now 6 + 5 = 11 storks and birds on the fence.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 4.0 + 13.0 ) * 15.0 )=255
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, so he is 13 feet + 4 feet = 17 feet tall.
2. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, so it is 15 * 17 feet = 255 feet deep.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron, so he is 13 feet + 4 feet = 17 feet tall.

2. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height, so it is 15 * 17 feet = 255 feet deep.

QUESTION: In a school there are 697 girls and the rest are boys. If there are 228 more girls than boysHow many boys are there in that school?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 697.0 - 228.0 )=469
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. First, we need to find the total number of students in the school. We can do this by adding the number of girls to the number of boys: 697 + x = total number of students.
2. Next, we need to subtract the number of girls from the total number of students to find the number of boys: total number of students - number of girls = number of boys.
3. Finally, we can plug in the values we know to find the number of boys in the school: 697 + x = total number of students, 697 + x - 697 = number of boys, x = number of boys.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. The total number of students in the school is 697 + x.
2. The number of boys in the school is 697 + x - 697 = x.
3. Therefore, there are x = 469 boys in the school.

2. 682 more girls joined the school, so there are 732 + 682 = 1414 girls in the school now.
3. 8 more boys joined the school, so there are 761 + 8 = 769 boys in the school now.
4. So, there are 1414 + 769 = 2183 students in the school now.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. There are 732 girls and 761 boys in the school. So, the total number of students is 732 + 761 = 1493.
2. 682 more girls joined the school, so the total number of girls is now 732 + 682 = 1414.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 415.0 - 149.0 )=266
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Nell originally had 309 + 356 = 665 cards.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. We first find the total number of cards Nell had originally by adding the number of baseball cards and the number of Ace cards: 309 + 356 = 665.
2. We then find the total number of cards Nell has now by adding the number of baseball cards and the number of Ace cards: 415 + 356 = 771.
3. We then subtract the number of cards Nell has now from the number of cards she had originally to find the number of cards she gave Jeff: 665 - 771 = 86.
4. We then subtract the number of cards Nell gave Jeff from the number of baseball cards she has now to find the number of baseball cards she has more than Ace cards: 415 - 86 = 329.

QUESTION: Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 17 of his marbles at the playground.How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 29.0 - 17.0 )=12
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had 29 + Doug = 29 + x marbles. After Ed lost 17 marbles, he had 29 + x - 17 = 29 + x - 17 marbles. Therefore, Ed had 29 + x - 17 - x = 29 - 17 = 12 more marbles than Doug.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had 29 + Doug = 29 + x marbles.
2. After Ed lost 17 marbles, he had 29 + x - 17 = 29 + x - 17 marbles.
3. Therefore, Ed had 29 + x - 17 - x = 29 - 17 = 12 more marbles than Doug.

ANSWER: ( 32.0 / 2.0 )=16
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

QUESTION: An industrial machine made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today. It can make 8 shirts a minute.How many minutes did the machine work in all?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 13.0 + 3.0 ) / 8.0 )=2
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts so it worked for 13 / 8 = 1.625 minutes.
2. Today, the machine made 3 shirts so it worked for 3 / 8 = 0.375 minutes.
3. The machine worked for 1.625 + 0.375 = 2 minutes in total.

**Explanation:**

1. The machine made 13 shirts yesterday so it worked for 13 / 8 = 1.625 minutes.
2. We can also calculate this by multiplying the number of shirts made by the number of minutes per shirt: 13 shirts * 1 minute / 8 shirts = 1.625 minutes.
3. Today, the machine made 3 shirts so it worked for 3 / 8 = 0.375 minutes.
4. We can also calculate this by multiplying the number of shirts made by the number of minutes per shirt: 3 shirts * 1 minute / 8 shirts = 0.375 minutes.
5. The machine worked for 1.625 + 0.375 = 2 minutes in total.

QUESTION: Danny collects bottle caps. He found 63 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 51 old ones. Now he has 33 bottle caps in his collection.How many bottle caps did danny have at first?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 33.0 + 51.0 ) - 63.0 )=21
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Chain-of-thought:
Danny started with x bottle caps. He found 63 more, so he now has x + 63 bottle caps. He threw away 51, so he now has x + 63 - 51 = x + 12 bottle caps. Now he has 33, so x + 12 = 33. Subtracting 12 from both sides gives x = 21.

The answer should be 21
