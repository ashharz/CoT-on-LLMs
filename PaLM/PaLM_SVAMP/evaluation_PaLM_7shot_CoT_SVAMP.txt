***********************************
ANSWER: ( 523.0 - 457.0 )66
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Step 1: Find the total number of crayons and erasers Paul had at the beginning of the school year.

QUESTION: Jake has 8 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than Steven. Steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches.How many more peaches than apples does Steven have?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 18.0 - 11.0 )7
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Step-by-step solution:
        Steven has 18 peaches and 11 apples, so he has 18 - 11 = 7 more peaches than apples.
        Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 18 - 8 = 10 peaches.
        Jake also has 10 more apples than Steven, so he has 11 + 10 = 21 apples.
        So, Steven has 7 more peaches than apples, and Jake has 21 apples.
        To find the total number of peaches that Steven and Jake have, we add their peach counts: 7 + 10 = 17.
        To find the total number of apples that Steven and Jake have, we add their apple counts: 11 + 21 = 32.
        So, Steven and Jake have 17 peaches and 32 apples.
        Therefore, Steven has 17 - 32 = 15 more peaches than apples.
        The answer is 15.
