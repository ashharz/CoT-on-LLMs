QUESTION: There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase.How many roses did she cut?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 17.0 - 15.0 )=2
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 2.

The total number of roses and orchids in the vase before Jessica cut some more is 15 + 62 = 77. The total number of roses and orchids in the vase after Jessica cut some more is 17 + 96 = 113. Therefore, Jessica cut 113 - 77 = 36 roses and orchids. Since the number of orchids increased by 34, the number of roses Jessica cut is 36 - 34 = 2.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 3.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 4.0 - 8.0 ) + 5.0 )=1
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 9.

We can solve this question by using the following steps:

1. Subtract the price of the candy bar from Dan's money to find out how much money he has left: 4 - 8 = -4.
2. Add the $5 that Dan's friend gave him to find out how much money he has now: -4 + 5 = 1.
3. Since the question asks how much money Dan has left, we need to add 1 to the total to find the answer: 1 + 1 = 2.

QUESTION: Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in gym class today. David did 58 more push-ups but 87 less crunches than zachary.How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 35.0 - 3.0 )=32
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 96.

We can solve this problem by first finding the total number of push-ups David did, which is 35 + 58 = 93. Then we can subtract the total number of crunches David did from the total number of push-ups he did to find the difference, which is 93 - 87 = 6. Finally, we can add the number of push-ups David did to the number of push-ups Zachary did to find the total number of push-ups they both did, which is 6 + 35 = 41. Then, we can subtract the total number of crunches Zachary did from the total number of push-ups they both did to find the difference, which is 41 - 3 = 38.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 20.

Let's think step-by-step.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 2.

Then subtract the number of children that got on the bus from the number of children that got off the bus to find the difference: 92 - 12 = 80.

QUESTION: In a school there are 632 girls and 410 boys. 465 more girls joined the school.How many more girls than boys does the school have?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 632.0 + 465.0 ) - 410.0 )=687

MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 1087.

The question is "In a school there are 632 girls and 410 boys. 465 more girls joined the school.How many more girls than boys does the school have?".

We can calculate the number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined the school: 632 + 465 = 1097.

Then we can calculate the difference between the number of girls and the number of boys: 1097 - 410 = 687.

Therefore, the answer is 687.

We can solve this question using the following steps:

1. First, we need to find the total cost of all 3 t-shirts. This is equal to $51.
2. Then, we need to divide the total cost by the number of t-shirts to find the cost of each t-shirt. This is equal to $51 / 3 = $17.

Therefore, the cost of each t-shirt is $17.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 317.0 - 295.0 )=22
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 22.

In the first question, there were 15 trees in the grove, and 21 trees after the grove workers planted trees. So the grove workers planted 21 - 15 = 6 trees. In the second question, there were 3 cars in the parking lot, and 2 more cars arrived. So there are 3 + 2 = 5 cars in the parking lot. In the third question, there were 317 visitors to the Buckingham palace that day, and 295 visitors the previous day. So there are 317 - 295 = 22 more visitors to the Buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day.

MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 1.

To answer this question, we need to know how many marbles Josh had in total after finding and losing some marbles. We can calculate it by adding the number of marbles he found and the number of marbles he lost: 6 + 3 = 9. Then we subtract the number of marbles he lost from the total number of marbles he had to find the number of marbles he found more than those he lost: 9 - 5 = 4.

QUESTION: Julia played tag with 19 kids on monday. She played tag with 18 kids on tuesday. She spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days.How many more kids did she play with on monday than on tuesday?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 19.0 - 18.0 )=1
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 1.

We know that Julia played tag with 19 kids on monday and 18 kids on tuesday. So she played with 19 + 18 = 37 kids on both days. Since she spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days, this means that she spent 38 / 37 = 1 hour more on tuesday than on monday. Since she played with 19 kids on monday and 18 kids on tuesday, this means that she played with 19 - 18 = 1 more kid on monday than on tuesday.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 8.0 / 4.0 )=2
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 2.

Matthew had 10 crackers and 8 cakes. So he had 10 + 8 = 18 total pieces of food. He gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends. So each person got 18 / 4 = 4 pieces of food. Since he gave each person 4 pieces of food and 4 pieces of food include 2 crackers and 2 cakes, each person got 2 cakes.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 16.

To solve this question, we need to know the total number of roses in the vase after Jessica cut some roses. The total number of roses is 19. The number of roses in the vase initially is 3. Therefore, Jessica cut 19 - 3 = 16 roses.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 576.0 / 8.0 )=72
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 72.

We can use the same logic as the first question to solve this question.

The number of pages Frank read per day is 8. The number of pages in the book is 576. We can divide the number of pages in the book by the number of pages Frank read per day to find the number of days it took him to finish the book. 576 / 8 = 72. Therefore, it took Frank 72 days to finish the book.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 16.0 - 13.0 )=3
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 3.

We can see that the total number of peaches is 16. The number of red peaches is 13. So the number of green peaches is 16 - 13 = 3.

QUESTION: After resting they decided to go for a swim. The depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height. Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron. If Ron stands at 14 feetHow deep was the water?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 14.0 - 8.0 ) * 2.0 )=12
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 40.

Let's solve this step-by-step.

First, we need to figure out how tall Dean is. Since Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron, who stands at 14 feet, Dean is 14 - 8 = 6 feet tall.

Next, we need to figure out how deep the water was. Since the depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height, and Dean is 6 feet tall, the water was 2 * 6 = 12 feet deep.

Finally, we need to round our answer to the nearest whole number. Since 12.0 is closer to 12 than 13, we can round our answer to 12 feet.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 23.

The grasshopper jumped 14 inches. The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, for a total of 14 + 37 = 51 inches. The mouse jumped 16 inches less than the frog, for a total of 51 - 16 = 35 inches. Thus, the mouse jumped 35 - 14 = 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

QUESTION: Faye was placing her pencils and crayons into 11 rows with 31 pencils and 27 crayons in each row.How many pencils and crayons does she have altogether?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 31.0 + 27.0 ) * 11.0 )=638
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 458.

We can use the following steps to solve the problem:
1. Multiply the number of pencils in each row by the number of rows to find the total number of pencils: 31 pencils / row * 11 rows = 341 pencils.
2. Multiply the number of crayons in each row by the number of rows to find the total number of crayons: 27 crayons / row * 11 rows = 307 crayons.
3. Add the total number of pencils and crayons to find the total number of pencils and crayons Faye has: 341 pencils + 307 crayons = 458 pencils and crayons.

QUESTION: The school is planning a field trip. The school has 87 classrooms. There are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students. If there are 2 seats on each school bus.How many buses are needed to take the trip?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 58.0 / 2.0 )=29
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 43.

The school has 87 classrooms and each classroom has 58 students. So the school has 87 * 58 = 5046 students. If each bus has 2 seats, then the school needs 5046 / 2 = 2523 buses.

However, the school does not have 2523 buses. So it needs to rent buses. The school needs to rent 2523 - 43 = 2480 buses.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 13.

Paco had 40 + 25 = 65 cookies. He ate 28 + 15 = 43 cookies. So he ate 43 - 65 = 22 more cookies than he had. We can also do this by subtracting the number of sweet cookies he ate from the number of salty cookies he ate: 28 - 15 = 13.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 10.

The machine made 13 + 3 = 16 shirts in total. So it worked 16 / 8 = 2 hours in total. And 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. So the machine worked 120 - 10 = 100 minutes in all.

**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 110.

First find the number of invitations Carol bought: 14 invitations / pack * 6 packs = 84 invitations. Then add the extra invitations she bought to find the total number of invitations: 84 invitations + 11 invitations = 95 invitations. Finally, divide the total number of invitations by the number of invitations per friend to find the number of friends she can invite: 95 invitations / 1 invitation / friend = 95 friends.
