If 450 students suggested adding mashed potatoes 38 suggested adding bacon to the menu and the rest did not participateHow many students participated in the suggestion of new food items?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 450.0 + 38.0 )=488
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: The answer is 528.

The number of students who suggested adding new food items is 450 + 38 = 488. The total number of students is 488 + the number of students who did not participate. Since the total number of choices is 66, the number of students who did not participate is 66 - 488 = 18. Therefore, the total number of students who participated is 488 + 18 = 528.

QUESTION: 23 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop 24 children got on the bus while some got off the bus. Then there were 8 children altogether on the bus.How many more children got off the bus than those that got on?
***********************************
