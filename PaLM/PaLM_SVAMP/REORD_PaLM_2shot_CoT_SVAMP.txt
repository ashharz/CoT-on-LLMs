There were 732 + 761 = 1493 students in the school originally. After more students joined, there are now 1493 + 682 + 8 = 2243 students in the school. So, there are now 2243 - 761 = 1482 girls in the school.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. There were 732 girls and 761 boys in the school originally.
2. 682 more girls and 8 more boys joined the school.
3. So, there are now 732 + 682 = 1414 girls in the school.
4. There are now 1414 + 8 = 1422 boys in the school.
5. So, there are now 1422 + 1414 = 2836 students in the school.
6. Therefore, there are now 2836 - 761 = 2075 girls in the school.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 7.0 / ( 4.0 + 3.0 ) )=1
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Let x be the number of baskets of peaches.
2. Each basket has 4 red peaches + 3 green peaches = 7 peaches.
3. So, x baskets have 4x red peaches + 3x green peaches = 7x peaches.
4. Since there are a total of 7 peaches, we have 7x = 7.
5. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 1.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. There are x baskets of peaches.
2. Each basket has 4 red peaches and 3 green peaches, so there are 4x red peaches and 3x green peaches in all baskets.
3. Since there are a total of 7 peaches, we have 4x + 3x = 7.
4. Combining like terms, we get 7x = 7.
5. Dividing both sides by 7, we get x = 1.

Therefore, there is 1 basket of peaches.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 246.0 + 703.0 )=949
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

On the previous day, 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace. On Rachel's day, 246 visitors came to the Buckingham palace. Therefore, a total of 703 + 246 = 949 visitors came to the Buckingham palace within 2 days. If we assume that the number of visitors to the Buckingham palace remains the same every day, then the total number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace within 25 days is 949 * 25 = 23725.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. On the previous day, 703 visitors came to the Buckingham palace.
2. On Rachel's day, 246 visitors came to the Buckingham palace.
3. Therefore, a total of 703 + 246 = 949 visitors came to the Buckingham palace within 2 days.
4. If we assume that the number of visitors to the Buckingham palace remains the same every day, then the total number of visitors who came to the Buckingham palace within 25 days is 949 * 25 = 23725.

QUESTION: Mary is baking a cake. The recipe calls for 12 cups of flour and 5 cups of sugar. She already put in some cups of flour. If she still needs 2 more cups of flourHow many cups of flour did she put in?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 12.0 - 2.0 )=10
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Step 1: She needs 12 - 2 = 10 cups of flour to finish the cake.
Step 2: She already put in some cups of flour so 10 + some = total cups of flour.
Step 3: So the total cups of flour is 10 + some = 12.
Step 4: Subtracting some from both sides gives 10 = 12 - some.
Step 5: Adding some to both sides gives some = 12 - 10 = 2.

So Mary put in 2 cups of flour.

QUESTION: If each bag has 41 cookies and you had 53 bags of cookiesHow many cookies would you have?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 53.0 * 41.0 )=2173
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. If each bag has 41 cookies, then 53 bags have 53 * 41 = 2173 cookies.
2. Therefore, if you have 53 bags of cookies, you would have 2173 cookies.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. First, we need to find the total number of cookies in each bag. To do this, we multiply the number of cookies in each bag by the number of bags. In this case, we have 41 cookies per bag and 53 bags, so we multiply 41 * 53 = 2173.
2. Now that we know the total number of cookies in each bag, we can multiply that number by the number of bags to find the total number of cookies. In this case, we have 2173 cookies per bag and 53 bags, so we multiply 2173 * 53 = 115569.

Therefore, if you have 53 bags of cookies, you would have 115569 cookies.

QUESTION: Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 17 of his marbles at the playground.How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 29.0 - 17.0 )=12
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Step-by-step solution:**

1. Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had 29 + Doug = 29 + x marbles.
2. Ed lost 17 of his marbles at the playground, so he had 29 + x - 17 = 29 + x - 17 marbles left.
3. Doug had x marbles, so Ed had 29 + x - 17 > x marbles more than Doug.
4. To find how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we subtract x from both sides of the inequality: 29 + x - 17 > x ⇒ 29 + x - 17 - x > x - x ⇒ 29 > 0.
5. Since 29 > 0, Ed had more marbles than Doug.
6. The final answer: 29.

QUESTION: The grasshopper, the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog.How much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 10.0 + 20.0 )=30
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

The frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches. The mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches. So the mouse jumped 49 - 19 = 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper. So the frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
2. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog. So the mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.
3. To find how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump. 49 - 19 = 30 inches.

QUESTION: A grocery store had 22 bottles of regular soda and 61 bottles of diet soda.How many more bottles of diet soda than regular soda did they have?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 61.0 - 22.0 )=39
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: The grocery store had 61 - 22 = 39 more bottles of diet soda than regular soda.



Step-by-step explanation:

1. First find the total number of bottles of soda by adding the number of regular soda bottles to the number of diet soda bottles.

22 bottles of regular soda + 61 bottles of diet soda = 83 bottles of soda.

2. Then subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the total number of bottles of soda to find the difference.

83 bottles of soda - 22 bottles of regular soda = 61 bottles of diet soda.

3. Finally, subtract the number of regular soda bottles from the number of diet soda bottles to find the number of more diet soda bottles than regular soda bottles.

61 bottles of diet soda - 22 bottles of regular soda = 39 more bottles of diet soda.

QUESTION: There were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase.How many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 20.0 - 11.0 )=9
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. There were 7 + 12 = 19 flowers in the vase before Jessica cut more.

3. There are 31 - 19 = 12 more orchids than roses in the vase now.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. First, we need to find the total number of flowers in the vase before Jessica cut more. To do this, we add the number of roses and the number of orchids: 7 + 12 = 19.
2. Next, we need to find the total number of flowers in the vase now. To do this, we add the number of roses and the number of orchids: 11 + 20 = 31.
3. Finally, we need to subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids to find the difference. 31 - 19 = 12. Therefore, there are 12 more orchids than roses in the vase now.

QUESTION: Frank was reading through his favorite book. He read 8 pages per day. If the book had 576 pagesHow many days did he take to finish the book?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 576.0 / 8.0 )=72
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Frank read 8 pages per day.
2. The book had 576 pages.
3. So, he took 576 / 8 = 72 days to finish the book.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

Total pages read = 8 pages / day * 72 days = 576 pages
```

2. Then, we need to divide the total number of pages by the number of pages per day to find the number of days it took Frank to finish the book.

```
Number of days = 576 pages / 8 pages / day = 72 days
```

3. Therefore, Frank took 72 days to finish the book.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 18.0 - 11.0 )=7
