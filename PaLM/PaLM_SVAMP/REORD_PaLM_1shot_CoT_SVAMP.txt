QUESTION: 43 children were riding on the bus. At the bus stop some children got off the bus. Then there were 21 children left on the bus.How many children got off the bus at the bus stop?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 43.0 - 21.0 )=22
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Step-by-step explanation:
        First find the difference between the number of children on the bus before and after the stop: 43 - 21 = 22. Then, divide that number by the number of children on the bus before the stop to find the average number of children who got off the bus at each stop: 22 / 43 = 0.5. Finally, multiply that average by the number of stops to find the total number of children who got off the bus: 0.5 * 4 = 2.

QUESTION: There were 3 dollars in Olivia's wallet. She collected 49 more dollars from an atm. After she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left.How much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 49.0 - 3.0 )=46
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution: Olivia had 3 dollars in her wallet before collecting 49 more dollars so she had 3 + 49 = 52 dollars. After visiting the supermarket Olivia had 49 dollars left so she spent 52 - 49 = 3 dollars.

Step-by-step explanation:
1. Olivia had 3 dollars in her wallet before collecting 49 more dollars so she had 3 + 49 = 52 dollars.
2. After visiting the supermarket Olivia had 49 dollars left so she spent 52 - 49 = 3 dollars.
3. Olivia collected 49 dollars at the atm and spent 3 dollars at the supermarket so she collected 49 - 3 = 46 dollars more at the atm than she spent at the supermarket.

QUESTION: Last week Fred had 19 dollars and Jason had 16 dollars. They washed cars over the weekend and now Fred has 40 dollars and Jason has 69 dollars.How much money did Fred earn over the weekend?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 40.0 - 19.0 )=21
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Fred had 19 dollars and Jason had 16 dollars, so they had a total of 19 + 16 = 35 dollars.
2. Fred now has 40 dollars and Jason has 69 dollars, so they have a total of 40 + 69 = 109 dollars.
3. Fred earned 109 - 35 = 74 dollars over the weekend.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. We can write an equation to represent the total amount of money Fred and Jason had before and after the weekend:

```
19 + 16 = 35
40 + 69 = 109
```

2. We can subtract the first equation from the second equation to find how much money Fred and Jason earned over the weekend:

```
109 - 35 = 74
```

3. We can divide the amount of money Fred and Jason earned over the weekend by the number of people to find how much money Fred earned:

```
74 / 2 = 37
```

Therefore, Fred earned 74 dollars over the weekend.

QUESTION: Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a dayHow many days would the soda bottles last?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 360.0 / 9.0 )=40
