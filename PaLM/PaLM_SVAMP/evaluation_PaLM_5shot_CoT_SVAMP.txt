QUESTION: Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling. On monday she had 4 bags of cans. The next day she found some more bags worth of cans. If she had a total of 6 bags altogetherHow many bags did she find on the next day?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 6.0 - 4.0 )2

x = 6 - 4 = 2.

Tiffany found 2 bags of cans on the next day.

Julia played tag with a total of 19 + 18 = 37 kids. She spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days. So she played tag for an average of 38 / 37 = 1 hour per kid. On monday, she played tag for 1 hour / kid * 19 kids = 19 hours. On tuesday, she played tag for 1 hour / kid * 18 kids = 18 hours. So she played with 19 - 18 = 1 more kid on monday than on tuesday.

QUESTION: Tiffany was collecting cans for recycling. On monday she had some bags of cans. The next day she found 4 more bags worth of cans. If she had a total of 8 bags altogetherHow many bags did she have on monday?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 8.0 - 4.0 )4
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

On Monday, Tiffany had x bags of cans. The next day, she found 4 more bags worth of cans, so she had x + 4 bags of cans. In total, Tiffany had x + x + 4 = 8 bags of cans. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 4 = 8. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 4. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 2. Tiffany had 2 bags of cans on Monday.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Tiffany had x bags of cans on Monday.
2. The next day, she found 4 more bags worth of cans, so she had x + 4 bags of cans.
3. In total, Tiffany had x + x + 4 = 8 bags of cans.
4. Combining like terms, we get 2x + 4 = 8.
5. Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 2x = 4.
6. Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 2.
7. Tiffany had 2 bags of cans on Monday.
