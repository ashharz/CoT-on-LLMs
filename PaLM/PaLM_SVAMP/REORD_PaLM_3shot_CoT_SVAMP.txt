QUESTION: In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girlsHow many pupils are there in that school?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 692.0 + 692.0 ) - 458.0 )=926
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Let X be the number of boys in the school.
2. Then, the number of girls in the school is X + 458.
3. Since the total number of pupils in the school is X + X + 458 = 2X + 458, we can substitute the value of X + 458 from step 2 into step 3 to get 2X + 458 = 692.
4. Subtracting 458 from both sides of the equation in step 3, we get 2X = 692 - 458 = 234.
5. Dividing both sides of the equation in step 4 by 2, we get X = 234 / 2 = 117.
6. Therefore, there are 117 boys in the school.
7. Since the total number of pupils in the school is 2X + 458 = 2(117) + 458 = 692 + 458 = 1150, there are 1150 pupils in the school.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. There are 692 girls in the school.
2. There are 458 more girls than boys, so there are 692 - 458 = 234 boys in the school.
3. The total number of pupils in the school is 234 + 692 = 926.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. There were 6 birds on the fence.
2. 4 more birds came to join them, so there are now 6 + 4 = 10 birds.
3. 8 more storks came to join them, so there are now 10 + 8 = 18 birds sitting on the fence.

QUESTION: Danny collects bottle caps and wrappers. He found 65 wrappers and 5 bottle caps at the park. Now he has 31 bottle caps and 9 wrappers in his collection.How many more wrappers than bottle caps did danny find at the park?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 65.0 - 5.0 )=60
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

Step 4: Subtract the number of bottle caps Danny found at the park from the number of wrappers he found to find the difference:

65 wrappers - 5 bottle caps = 60 wrappers.

Therefore, Danny found 60 more wrappers than bottle caps at the park.

QUESTION: There were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. There are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase.How many roses did she cut?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 17.0 - 15.0 )=2
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: Solution:

There were originally 15 roses + 62 orchids = 77 flowers in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 17 roses + 96 orchids = 113 flowers in the vase.

1. There were originally 15 roses + 62 orchids = 77 flowers in the vase.
2. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 17 roses + 96 orchids = 113 flowers in the vase.
3. So, Jessica cut 113 flowers - 77 flowers = 36 flowers.

MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

There were 2 + 3 = 5 birds on the fence after the 3 new birds came. So, there were 5 + 6 = 11 birds and storks on the fence in total. Therefore, there are 11 - 5 = 6 more storks than birds on the fence.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. There were 2 birds on the fence originally.
2. 3 more birds came to join them, so there were now 2 + 3 = 5 birds on the fence.
3. There were also 6 storks on the fence originally.
4. So, there were 5 + 6 = 11 birds and storks on the fence in total.
5. Therefore, there are 11 - 5 = 6 more storks than birds on the fence.

QUESTION: Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 17 of his marbles at the playground.How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 29.0 - 17.0 )=12
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. Ed had 29 + 17 = 46 marbles after losing 17 marbles.
2. Doug had 46 - 29 = 17 marbles.
3. Therefore, Ed had 46 - 17 = 29 more marbles than Doug.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Let's say Ed had x marbles. Then Doug had x - 29 marbles.
2. After losing 17 marbles, Ed had x - 17 marbles.
3. Doug still had x - 29 marbles.
4. So, x - 17 - (x - 29) = 29.
5. Simplifying, we get x - x + 12 = 29.
6. Adding x to both sides, we get 12 = 29 + x.
7. Subtracting 29 from both sides, we get -17 = x.
8. Therefore, Ed had 17 marbles.
9. Doug had 17 - 29 = -12 marbles.

***********************************
ANSWER: ( 52.0 / 26.0 )=2
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

1. First find the total number of cookies and candies you had: 52 cookies + 15 candies = 67.
2. Then divide that number by the number of bags to find how many cookies were in each bag: 67 cookies / 26 bags = 2.5 cookies / bag.
3. Finally, round that number to the nearest whole number to find the final answer: 2.5 cookies / bag ≈ 3 cookies / bag.

**Step-by-step explanation:**
