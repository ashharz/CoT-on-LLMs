***********************************
ANSWER: ( 523.0 - 457.0 )66
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

        At the beginning of the school year, Paul had 457 erasers + 617 crayons = 1074 school supplies. At the end of the school year, Paul had 523 crayons + 457 erasers = 980 school supplies. So, Paul had 980 - 1074 = 94 fewer school supplies at the end of the school year than at the beginning. Since Paul didn't lose any erasers, he had 94 fewer crayons than erasers at the end of the school year. So, Paul had 94 / 457 = 0.206 more crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.

        **Step-by-step explanation:**

        1. Paul had 457 erasers and 617 crayons for his birthday, for a total of 457 + 617 = 1074 school supplies.

        4. Since Paul didn't lose any erasers, he had 94 fewer crayons than erasers at the end of the school year.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches, so he did 35 - 3 = 32 more push-ups than crunches.
2. David did 58 more push-ups than Zachary, so he did 58 + 32 = 90 push-ups.
