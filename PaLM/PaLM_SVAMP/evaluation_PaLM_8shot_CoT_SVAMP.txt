***********************************
ANSWER: ( 19.0 - 18.0 )1
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Step-by-step solution:**

1. Julia played tag with 19 kids on monday and 18 kids on tuesday, so she played with 19 + 18 = 37 kids in total.
2. She spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days, so each day she spent 38 / 2 = 19 hours.

4. On tuesday, Julia spent 19 hours playing tag with 18 kids, so each kid played for 19 / 18 = 1.05 hours.
5. Therefore, Julia played with 1 more kid on monday than on tuesday because 1.05 < 1.

QUESTION: Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug. Ed lost 17 of his marbles at the playground.How many more marbles did Ed have than Doug then?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 29.0 - 17.0 )12
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Step-by-step solution:**

1. Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had 29 + Doug = 29 + d marbles.
2. Ed lost 17 of his marbles, so he had 29 + d - 17 = 29 + d - 17 marbles left.
3. Ed had 29 more marbles than Doug, so Doug had 29 + d - 29 = d marbles.
4. Ed had 29 + d - 17 marbles left, so Doug had d - 29 - 17 = d - 46 marbles.
5. Ed had 29 + d - 17 marbles left, so Ed had 29 + d - 17 - (d - 46) = 29 + d - 17 - d + 46 = 65 marbles.
6. Ed had 65 marbles, so Ed had 65 - d = 65 - d marbles more than Doug.
7. The answer is 65 - d.

QUESTION: Last week Fred had 19 dollars and Jason had 16 dollars. They washed cars over the weekend and now Fred has 40 dollars and Jason has 69 dollars.How much money did Fred earn over the weekend?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 40.0 - 19.0 )21
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Step-by-step solution:**

Fred started with 19 dollars and earned x dollars over the weekend. So he now has 19 + x = 40 dollars. Jason started with 16 dollars and earned y dollars over the weekend. So he now has 16 + y = 69 dollars. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get x + y = 69 - 19 = 50 dollars. Since y = 69 - 16 = 53 dollars, then x = 50 - y = 50 - 53 = -3 dollars. The answer is -3.

QUESTION: Debby bought 360 soda bottles and 162 water bottles when they were on sale. If she drank 122 water bottles and 9 soda bottles a dayHow many days would the soda bottles last?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 360.0 / 9.0 )40
