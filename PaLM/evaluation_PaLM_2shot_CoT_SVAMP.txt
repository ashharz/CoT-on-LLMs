QUESTION: A waiter had some customers. After 9 customers left he still had 12 customers.How many customers did he have at the start?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 9.0 + 12.0 )=21

QUESTION: In a school there are 458 more girls than boys. If there are 692 girlsHow many pupils are there in that school?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( ( 692.0 + 692.0 ) - 458.0 )=926
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

        There are 458 more girls than boys, so there are 692 + 458 = 1150 girls and boys in total. The answer is 1150.

        **Step-by-step explanation:**

        1. Let x be the number of boys in the school.
        2. There are 692 + x girls in the school.
        3. There are 692 + x = x + 458 girls and boys in total.
        4. Subtracting x from both sides, we get 692 = 458.
        5. Adding 458 to both sides, we get 1150 = x + 458 + x.
        6. Combining like terms, we get 1150 = 2x + 458.
        7. Subtracting 458 from both sides, we get 692 = 2x.
        8. Dividing both sides by 2, we get 346 = x.
        9. Therefore, there are 346 boys in the school.
        10. There are 692 + 346 = 1150 boys and girls in total.

MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

        There were originally 16 roses + 3 orchids = 19 flowers in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 13 roses + 7 orchids = 20 flowers in the vase. So she cut 20 flowers - 19 flowers = 1 flower. Since there were 3 orchids originally, and she cut 1 orchid, she cut 3 orchids - 1 orchid = 2 orchids.

        **Step-by-step explanation:**

        1. There were originally 16 roses + 3 orchids = 19 flowers in the vase.
        2. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 13 roses + 7 orchids = 20 flowers in the vase.
        3. So she cut 20 flowers - 19 flowers = 1 flower.
        4. Since there were 3 orchids originally, and she cut 1 orchid, she cut 3 orchids - 1 orchid = 2 orchids.
