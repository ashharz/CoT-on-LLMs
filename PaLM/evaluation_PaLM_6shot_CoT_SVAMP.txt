QUESTION: Zachary did 35 push-ups and 3 crunches in gym class today. David did 58 more push-ups but 87 less crunches than zachary.How many more push-ups than crunches did Zachary do?
***********************************
ANSWER: ( 35.0 - 3.0 )32
**********************************
MODEL's_ANSWER: **Solution:**

Zachary did 35 + 58 = 93 push-ups. Zachary did 3 - 87 = -84 crunches. Zachary did 93 - -84 = 177 more push-ups than crunches.

**Step-by-step explanation:**

1. First, find the total number of push-ups Zachary did by adding the number of push-ups he did to the number of extra push-ups David did: 35 push-ups + 58 push-ups = 93 push-ups.
2. Then, find the total number of crunches Zachary did by subtracting the number of extra crunches David did from the number of crunches Zachary did: 3 crunches - 87 crunches = -84 crunches.
3. Finally, subtract the number of crunches Zachary did from the number of push-ups he did to find the difference: 93 push-ups - -84 crunches = 177 push-ups.
