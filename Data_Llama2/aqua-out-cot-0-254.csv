0,"[INST]A car is being driven , in a straight line and at a uniform speed , towards the base of a vertical tower . The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?
Answer Choices:
A) 5 ( √ 3 + 1)
B) 6 ( √ 3 + √ 2)
C) 7 ( √ 3 – 1)
D) 8 ( √ 3 – 2)
E) None of these[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles.
The angle of elevation of the tower is increasing from 45° to 60°, which means that the angle between the line of sight and the base of the tower is also increasing. Since the car is moving in a straight line, the angle between the line of sight and the base of the tower is constant.
Let's call the distance from the base of the tower to the point where the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° as x.
Using the concept of similar triangles, we can draw a triangle with the base as the distance from the base of the tower to the point where the angle of elevation changes, and the height as the distance from the point where the angle of elevation changes to the top of the tower.
The height of the tower is given as √3 times the distance from the base to the point where the angle of elevation changes. So, the height of the tower is:
H = √3x

The time taken for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is 10 minutes. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the distance traveled by the car during this time is also constant. Let's call this distance as y.
We can now use the concept of similar triangles to find the time taken for the car to reach the base of the tower.
The distance traveled by the car is equal to the height of the tower times the cosine of the angle of elevation:
y = H \* cos(60° - 45°)
= H \* cos(15°)
= H \* 0.5
= √3x \* 0.5
= x/2

Therefore, the car will reach the base of the tower in 2x/2 = x minutes.
So, the answer is (E) None of these.",A
1,"[INST]The original price of an item is discounted 22 % . A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $ 20 - off coupon . There is no tax on the item , and this was the only item the customer bought . If the customer paid $ 1.90 more than half the original price of the item , what was the original price of the item ?
Answer Choices:
A) $ 61
B) $ 65
C) $ 67.40
D) $ 70
E) $ 78.20[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find the original price of the item.
The original price of the item was discounted by 22%, which means it was sold for $0.7820 \* 0.72 = $0.5744 less than the original price.
The customer used a $20-off coupon, which means they paid $0.5744 - $20 = $0.4744 for the item.
Since there is no tax on the item, the customer paid a total of $0.4744.
The question asks for the amount that is more than half the original price of the item. Since the original price was $0.5744, the amount that is more than half is $0.5744 / 2 = $0.2870.
So, the original price of the item was $0.5744.
Therefore, the answer is (A) $61.",E

A) 0.22
B) 0.26
C) 0.37
D) 0.46
E) 0.63[/INST]  To find the greatest value for the probability that neither of the two events will occur, we need to calculate the probability of the complement of each event and then find the maximum of these probabilities.
The probability of Stock A increasing in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability of Stock B increasing in value during the next month is 0.74.
The complement of Stock A increasing in value during the next month is:
Complement of Stock A = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
The complement of Stock B increasing in value during the next month is:
Complement of Stock B = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26
Now, we need to find the maximum of these two probabilities:
Maximum = 0.44 (Complement of Stock A) or 0.26 (Complement of Stock B)
Therefore, the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur is:
E) 0.63

E) 315[/INST]  To find the cost price of the article, we can use the formula:
Cost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Percentage)

Given:
Selling Price = Rs. 360
Profit Percentage = 20%

Now, we can plug in the values and solve for the cost price:
Cost Price = Selling Price / (1 + Profit Percentage)
= 360 / (1 + 0.20)

Answer Choices:
A) 40
B) 200
C) 380
D) 400
E) 3200[/INST]  Let's break down the problem step by step:
1. The first time 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag, and 1 of them was black, so the percentage of black marbles in the bag is 1/20 = 0.05.
2. Then, another 20 marbles were pulled out, including 1 black marble. So, the total number of marbles in the bag is now 20 + 20 = 40 marbles.
3. After the second round of pulling marbles, the total number of black marbles is 1 + 1 = 2, which is 0.05% of the total number of marbles in the bag.
Now, we can use the information we have to find the total number of marbles in the bag:
Total number of marbles = 40 + 20 = 60 marbles
So, the answer is (D) 400.",D

D) 65000
E) 97656[/INST]  To find the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers, we need to count the number of possible combinations.
There are 26 letters in the alphabet, and each letter can be used twice, so there are 26 x 2 = 52 possible combinations of letters.
For each combination of letters, we can choose 2 numbers from 0 to 9, so there are 52 x 2 = 104 possible combinations of letters and numbers.
Therefore, the total number of distinct bike numbers that can be formed using 2 letters followed by 2 numbers is 104.

Answer Choices:
A) 10
B) 11.5
C) 12.5
D) 13.5
E) 15[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of uniform speed and the formula for time taken to cover a distance at a constant speed.
Let the distance be x miles.
Initially, the train was running at a speed of 100 miles/hour, so it covered 100x miles in 10 hours.
After covering quarter of the distance, the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour, so it covers 75x miles in the same time.
So, the total distance covered by the train is:
x + 75x = 100x
Simplifying the equation, we get:
85x = 100x
x = 12.5
So, the total journey duration is:
10 hours + (12.5 / 75) x 3 = 15 hours
Therefore, the answer is (D) 13.5 hours.",C

A) 27
B) 81
C) 90
D) 99
E) 110[/INST]  To find the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session, we need to find the intersection of the two sets of students who attended the prom night and those who took part in the debating session.
Let's use Venn diagrams to visualize the situation:
| | Prom Night | Debating Session | Neither |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attended Prom Night | 45% of 200 | 35% of 200 | 200 - (45% + 35%) |
From the diagram, we can see that at least 200 - (45 + 35) = 125 students did not attend either the prom night or the debating session. Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is 125.
So, the answer is (E) 110.",E

C) 25
D) 40
E) 52[/INST]  To find out how many sales the sales person needs to make to reach a salary of at least $1000, we can use the following formula:

Salary = Commission per sale x Number of sales
Salary = $1000
Commission per sale = $250
Number of sales =  Salary / Commission per sale
Number of sales = $1000 / $250
Number of sales = 4
Therefore, the sales person needs to make 4 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000. The answer is (D) 40.",D
10,"[INST]A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month , at a production cost to the company of $ 110 per component , and sells all of the components by the end of each month . What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit ( revenue from sales minus production costs ) will be at least $ 626,400 ?
Answer Choices:
A) 226
B) 230
C) 240
D) 260
E) 280[/INST]  To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the total revenue from sales and subtract the total production costs.
Total revenue = Number of components produced x Selling price per component
= 420 x (Price per component)
Total production costs = Number of components produced x Production cost per component
= 420 x $110
Total revenue - Total production costs = Minimum selling price per component
To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to solve the equation:
$626,400 = Total revenue - Total production costs
$626,400 = 420 x (Price per component)
To find the minimum price per component, we can divide both sides of the equation by 420:
(Price per component) = $626,400 / 420
= $145
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $145 per component.
The answer is (A) $226.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 24 minutes
B) 32 minutes
C) 36 minutes
D) 64 minutes
E) 72 minutes[/INST]  To find out when they will produce 10 yo-yos, we need to calculate the total time they will be running.
Machine A produces a yo-yo every 6 minutes, so it will produce 6 yo-yos in 1 hour (60 minutes).
Machine B produces a yo-yo every 9 minutes, so it will produce 9 yo-yos in 1 hour (60 minutes).
Both machines will run for a total of 120 minutes (60 minutes x 2 machines).
To find out when they will produce 10 yo-yos, we can divide the total time they will run by the time it takes each machine to produce one yo-yo:
120 minutes / 6 minutes = 3.33 machines
So, they will produce 10 yo-yos in 3.33 hours (120 minutes / 3.33 machines = 36 minutes).
Therefore, the answer is (C) 36 minutes.",C

Since A and B are independent events, we know that P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B).
So,
P(A/B) = P(A)P(B) / P(A ∩ B)

Answer Choices:
A) 1 step / minute
B) 2 step / minute
C) 3 step / minute
D) 4 step / minute
E) None of the above[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question to find the time it takes to travel a certain number of steps.
Let's start by analyzing the information given in the question:
* If you walk 20 steps and stop, it takes 10 minutes to reach the bottom.
* If you walk 10 steps and stop, it takes 20 minutes to reach the ground.
From these two pieces of information, we can set up a proportion to find the speed of the elevator:
Let's call the speed of the elevator ""x"" steps per minute.
From the first piece of information, we know that it takes 10 minutes to travel 20 steps. So, we can write an equation:
20 steps / 10 minutes = x steps / minute
Similarly, from the second piece of information, we know that it takes 20 minutes to travel 10 steps. So, we can write another equation:
10 steps / 20 minutes = x steps / minute
Now, we can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the value of ""x"":
20 steps / 10 minutes = x steps / minute
x = 2 steps / minute
Therefore, the speed of the elevator is 2 steps per minute.
So, the answer is (B) 2 step / minute.",A

D) ( zy – 2 x) / ( z - 2)
E) ( zy – x) / ( z + 2)[/INST]  To find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers, we need to find the average of the remaining scores.
We are given that the average of the highest and lowest scores is equal to x. Let's call the highest score ""H"" and the lowest score ""L"". Then, we can write:
x = (H + L) / 2
We are also given that there are z > 5 students in the class. Let's call the z - 5th student ""S"". Then, the total score of the class is:
Total score = H + L + S + ... + (z - 5)th student
We are also given that the average score for the entire class is equal to y. Therefore, we can write:
y = Total score / z
Now, we want to find the average score of the remaining students, excluding the highest and lowest scorers. We can do this by subtracting the highest and lowest scores from the total score, and then dividing by the number of students minus 5:
Average score = (Total score - H - L) / (z - 5)

Answer Choices:
A) 12
B) 16
C) 24
D) 30
E) 40[/INST]  To find out how many bags the grocer sold, we need to use the information given in the problem:

The grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price of each bag of flour.
The selling price of each bag of flour is $100.
The grocer makes $3,000 in profit.
We can start by finding out how much profit the grocer makes on each bag of flour:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price
Since the cost price is not given, we cannot find the profit for each bag of flour. However, we can use the information that the grocer makes a 25% profit on the selling price to find the total profit.
Profit = 25% of $100 = $25
So, the grocer makes $25 in profit on each bag of flour.
Now, we can find out how many bags the grocer sold by dividing the total profit by the profit per bag:
Number of bags = Total profit / Profit per bag
Number of bags = $3,000 / $25 = 120
Therefore, the grocer sold 120 bags of flour.

D) 1320
E) 1200[/INST]  To find the area of the sheet, we need to find the area of each half and then add them together.
From the problem statement, we know that the perimeter of each half is 48 cm when folded along one set of sides, and 66 cm when folded along the other set of sides.
Let's call the length of the sheet x cm.
When folded along the first set of sides, the length of each half is x/2 cm. The perimeter of each half is 48 cm, so the area of each half is:
Area of each half = Perimeter / 2 = 48 cm / 2 = 24 cm^2
When folded along the second set of sides, the length of each half is x/2 cm again. The perimeter of each half is 66 cm, so the area of each half is:
Area of each half = Perimeter / 2 = 66 cm / 2 = 33 cm^2
So, the area of the entire sheet is the sum of the areas of the two halves:

To find the monthly sales required to reach a monthly salary of $1500, we need to solve the equation:
$1500 = $500 + 0.05 x M
Where M is the monthly sales.
Solving for M, we get:
M = $30000

39,"[INST]An aeroplane flies along the four sides of a square at the speeds of 200 , 400 , 600 and 800 km / hr . Find the average speed of the plane around the field ?
Answer Choices:
A) 384
B) 562
C) 458
D) 156
E) 452[/INST]  To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to find the distance the plane travels around the field and divide it by the time it takes to travel that distance.
Let's first find the distance the plane travels around the field. Since the plane flies along the four sides of a square, the distance it travels along each side is the length of the side of the square.
The length of each side of the square is 100 km.
So, the distance the plane travels around the field is:
Distance = 4 x 100 km = 400 km
Now, let's find the time it takes the plane to travel this distance. We know the speeds of the plane at each side of the square:
Speed at each side = 200 km/hr, 400 km/hr, 600 km/hr, and 800 km/hr.
We can find the time it takes the plane to travel the distance around the field by using the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
For example, if the plane travels at a speed of 200 km/hr, it will take:
Time = 400 km / 200 km/hr = 2 hours
Similarly, the time it takes the plane to travel the distance around the field at each of the other speeds is:
Time at 400 km/hr = 2 hours
Time at 600 km/hr = 1.33 hours
Time at 800 km/hr = 0.75 hours
Now, we add up all these times to find the total time it takes the plane to travel around the field:
Total time = 2 + 2 + 1.33 + 0.75 = 6.33 hours
Finally, we divide the distance traveled by the total time to find the average speed of the plane around the field:
Average speed = 400 km / 6.33 hours = 65.1 km/hr
So, the average speed of the plane around the field is 65.1 km/hr.
Therefore, the answer is (C) 458 km/hr.",A

C) 31500
D) 50000
E) None of these[/INST]  To find the minimum sale required for the servant to earn a monthly income of 6000, we need to use the information given in the problem:

The shopkeeper pays the servant a monthly salary of 1500 and a commission of 15% on the monthly sale.
So, the total amount the shopkeeper pays the servant is:
1500 (monthly salary) + (1500 x 15%) = 1500 + 2250 = 3750

The servant wants his monthly income to be 6000. So, we need to find the minimum sale required to generate a profit of 6000 after paying the salary and commission.
Let's assume the sale is x.
The shopkeeper pays the servant a commission of 15% on the sale. So, the total amount the shopkeeper pays the servant is:
1500 (monthly salary) + (1500 x 15%) = 3750
The servant's commission is 15% of the sale, so the servant's total earnings are:
1500 (monthly salary) + (1500 x 15%) = 3750
The servant's total earnings are equal to the minimum sale required to generate a profit of 6000 after paying the salary and commission.
So, the minimum sale required is:
3750 x 1500 / 6000 = 31500

Therefore, the answer is (C) 31500.",A

New price = Original price x (1 - Percentage reduction)
New price = $100 x (1 - 0.30)
New price = $70
To find the percentage increase needed to bring the price back to $100, we can divide the difference between the original price and the new price by the original price:
Percentage increase = (Original price - New price) / Original price
Percentage increase = ($100 - $70) / $100 = 40%
Therefore, the answer is (D) 44.86%.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 453
B) 651
C) 400
D) 487
E) 286[/INST]  To find the number of each type of coin in the money pouch, we can use the information given in the problem:
The money pouch contains Rs 700.
There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and one rupee coins.
So, we can start by dividing the total amount of money by the value of each coin:
Rs 700 / Rs 25 paise = x coins
Rs 700 / Rs 50 paise = y coins
Rs 700 / Rs 1 rupee = z coins

Answer Choices:
A) 22
B) 27
C) 29
D) Can not be determined
E) None of the above[/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:
R is older than T, and the sum of their ages is 50 years.
We can write an equation based on this information:
R + T = 50

Now, we are asked to find the difference between R and Q's age. Since Q is younger than R, we can say:
Q - R = x

We are given that Q is x years younger than R, so we can substitute this value in the equation:
Q - R = x

Now, we can solve for the difference between R and Q's age:
R - Q = 50 - x

Now, we have two possible values for x:
x = 22
or
x = 27

So, the difference between R and Q's age is either:
R - Q = 50 - 22 = 28

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source , how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins ?
Answer Choices:
A) 8.5
B) 10.5
C) 12.5
D) 14.5
E) 16.5[/INST]  To determine the amount of health food that must be consumed daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins E and A, we need to calculate the total daily requirement of both vitamins and then divide it by the percentage of the minimum daily requirement provided by the health food.
The minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 15 mg (milligrams) for adult men and 12 mg for adult women. The minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 700 mcg (micrograms) for adult men and 650 mcg for adult women.
According to the problem, 1 gram of the health food contains 9 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E and 8 percent of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A. Therefore, the total daily requirement of both vitamins in grams is:
9% of 15 mg = 0.135 mg (vitamin E)
8% of 700 mcg = 56 mcg (vitamin A)
So, the total daily requirement of both vitamins in grams is:
0.135 mg + 56 mcg = 0.191 g
To determine the number of grams of health food that must be consumed daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we divide the total daily requirement by the percentage of the minimum daily requirement provided by the health food:
0.191 g / 0.09 = 2.12 grams of health food per day (for vitamin E)
0.191 g / 0.08 = 2.37 grams of health food per day (for vitamin A)
Therefore, the answer is:
A) 8.5 grams of health food per day (to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins)",C

20 large cakes = 20 x 2 = 40 cakes per hour
700 small cakes = 35 x 70 = 2450 cakes per hour
Therefore, we need:
Number of helpers = Total number of cakes / Number of cakes each helper can make per hour
= 40 + 2450 = 2490 / 2 = 124.5 helpers
Since we can't have a fraction of a helper, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 13 helpers.
Therefore, the answer is (B) 10 helpers.",B

Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls.
Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes.
Two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as one pita bread.
Now, let's convert the given ratios into fractions:
Six pita breads = 2 rolls (since 6/2 = 3)
Two rolls = 1/3 falafel
Three rolls = 5 baguettes (since 3/1 = 5)
Two baguettes = 1/6 falafel (since 2/1 = 2)
Now, we can use the information that two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as one pita bread to find the number of pita breads:
2 baguettes = 1/6 falafel
1/6 = 5/6
So, there are 5 pita breads for every 6 baguettes.

In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned. This means that there were 300 - 20 = 280 deer in the forest that did not have tags.
In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. This means that there were 500 - 20 = 480 deer in the forest that did not have tags.
The passage states that the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags. So, if 20 out of 500 deer (or 4%) had tags in the sample, then the percent of deer in the forest with tags is also 4%.
To find the total deer population in the forest, we can multiply the percent of deer with tags by the total number of deer in the forest in 2001:
4% of 280 deer = 112 deer (in 2002)
So, the total deer population in the forest in 2002 is:
280 + 112 = 392 deer.
Therefore, the answer is (E) 7500.",E

Answer Choices:
A) 2 % Profit
B) 3 % Profit
C) 2 % Loss
D) 3 % Loss
E) 4 % Loss[/INST]  To find the percentage of profit or loss, we need to calculate the difference between the selling price and the cost price, and then divide it by the cost price.
Let's assume the cost price of the book is Rs. 25.
If the book is sold for Rs. 27.50, the profit is:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 27.50 - 25 = Rs. 2.50
If the book is sold for Rs. 25.75, the profit is:
Profit = Selling price - Cost price = 25.75 - 25 = Rs. 0.75
So, the percentage of profit is:
Profit percentage = (Profit/Cost price) x 100
For Rs. 27.50:
Profit percentage = (2.50/25) x 100 = 10%
For Rs. 25.75:
Profit percentage = (0.75/25) x 100 = 3%

D) 25
E) 31[/INST]  To find the measure of each side of the square that will be formed by re-bending the rectangle, we need to use the fact that the area of a square is equal to the length of its side squared.
The length of the rectangle is 27 cm and the breadth is 17 cm, so the area of the rectangle is:
Area = length x breadth = 27 x 17 = 469 cm^2
Since the rectangle is being rebent to form a square, the length and breadth of the square will be the same. Let's call the length of the side of the square ""s"".
We know that the area of the square is equal to the length of its side squared, so we can set up the equation:
s^2 = 469
Solving for ""s"", we get:

Cost Price = Rs 1200 / -
Cost Price = Rs 1200
Next, let's calculate the selling price of the sewing machine after offering a 20% discount:
Selling Price = Cost Price - (Cost Price x Discount Percentage)
Selling Price = Rs 1200 - (Rs 1200 x 20%)
Selling Price = Rs 1200 - Rs 240
Selling Price = Rs 960
Now, let's find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine so that he makes a 20% profit:
Profit Percentage = (Selling Price - Cost Price) / Cost Price x 100
Profit Percentage = (Rs 960 - Rs 1200) / Rs 1200 x 100
Profit Percentage = -25%
To find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine, we need to divide the profit percentage by 100:
Price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine = Rs 1200 / -25%
Price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine = Rs 1200 / -25% = Rs 1600
Therefore, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine is Rs 1600.
So, the answer is (D) Rs 1600.",E

Answer Choices:
A) 12 am on the next day
B) 5 am on the next day
C) 5 pm on the next day
D) 2 pm on the next day
E) None of these[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which two objects move relative to each other. In this case, we are given the speeds of the two trains, Train 'A' and Train 'B', and we need to find the time at which they will meet each other.
Let's first calculate the relative speed between Train 'A' and Train 'B':
Relative speed = (Speed of Train 'B' - Speed of Train 'A')
= (72 kmph - 40 kmph)
= 32 kmph
Now, we need to find the time at which the two trains will meet each other, considering that they are moving in the same direction. We can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Relative speed
We are given that the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow is 500 km.
Time = Distance / Relative speed
Time = 500 km / 32 kmph
= 16 hours
Therefore, the two trains will meet each other at 16 hours after Train 'B' leaves Mumbai Central.
So, the answer is (D) 2 pm on the next day.",A

D) y 2 / x 2 units
E) None of these[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem:
x men working x hours per day can do x units of work in x days
We are given that x = 5 men working 8 hours per day can do 40 units of work in 5 days.
So, we can start by writing an equation based on the information given:
5 men x 8 hours/day = 40 units/5 days
Now, we are asked to find the work that can be completed by y men working y hours per day in y days.
We can use the same equation as before, but with y men and y hours:
y men x y hours/day = ? units/y days
We are given that y = 3 men working 6 hours per day. So, we can plug this value into the equation:
3 men x 6 hours/day = ? units/y days
Now, we need to find the answer to the equation. We can do this by solving for the unknown variable (units/y days) on both sides of the equation:
units/y days = 5 x 8 hours/day / 5 days
units/y days = 40 / 5

C) 25 < x < 64
D) 28 < x < 60
E) None of these[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to find the value of x that satisfies the inequality given in the statement.
We are given that $36 \leq n \leq 72$, so we can write $n = 36, 42, 50, \ldots, 72$.
Now, let's evaluate the expression $x = (n^2 + 2\sqrt{n}(n+4) + 16)/(n+4\sqrt{n} + 4)$ for each value of $n$.
For $n = 36$, we have:
$$x = \frac{(36)^2 + 2\sqrt{36}(36+4) + 16}{36+4\sqrt{36} + 4} = \frac{1296 + 128 + 16}{130 + 48 + 4} = 144$$
For $n = 42$, we have:
$$x = \frac{(42)^2 + 2\sqrt{42}(42+4) + 16}{42+4\sqrt{42} + 4} = \frac{1764 + 160 + 16}{160 + 64 + 4} = 148$$
For $n = 50$, we have:
$$x = \frac{(50)^2 + 2\sqrt{50}(50+4) + 16}{50+4\sqrt{50} + 4} = \frac{2500 + 200 + 16}{200 + 80 + 4} = 164$$

Answer Choices:
A) 8.75
B) 8.79
C) 8.75
D) 8.71
E) 8.72[/INST]  To find the area of the remaining paper after cutting the semi circles, we need to first find the area of each semi circle and then subtract it from the total area of the original paper.
The diameter of each semi circle is 20 cm, so the area of each semi circle is:
Area of semi circle = πr^2, where r = 10 cm (since the diameter is 20 cm)
Area of semi circle = π(10)^2 = 100 cm^2
Now, let's find the area of the remaining paper:
Total area of paper = Area of square - Area of semi circles
= 20 cm x 20 cm - 2 x 100 cm^2
= 400 cm^2 - 200 cm^2
= 200 cm^2
So, the area of the remaining paper is 200 cm^2.

C) M + N / 4
D) M + 3 N / 8
E) M + N / 5[/INST]  To find the average speed of the athlete for the combined activities, we need to use the formula:
Average speed = Total distance / Time taken
For the running activity, the athlete ran M miles in 4 hours, so the distance covered in 1 hour is:
M / 4 = M / 1 = M miles/hour
For the cycling activity, the athlete rode N miles in the same number of hours, so the distance covered in 1 hour is:
N / 4 = N / 1 = N miles/hour
Now, let's combine the distances covered in 1 hour for both activities:
Total distance = M + N = 2M + 2N
Since the athlete took the same amount of time for both activities, the average speed for the combined activities is:
Average speed = Total distance / Time taken = (2M + 2N) / 4 = M + N / 4
So, the answer is (C) M + N / 4.",A

2. He turned right around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
3. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
From this information, we can set up the following equation:
Distance = Speed x Time
We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the distance he traveled during that leg of the trip is:
Distance = 70 mph x 3 hours = 210 miles
Now, we need to find out how far he traveled during the return trip. Since he turned right around and returned to A, the distance he traveled during the return trip is the same as the distance he traveled during the outbound trip. So, we can use the same equation:
Distance = Speed x Time
We know that Kevin returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, so the distance he traveled during the return trip is:
Distance = 90 mph x 3 hours = 270 miles
Now, we need to find the distance between A and B. We know that Kevin was 70 miles away from B when he turned around, so the distance between A and B is:
Distance = 70 miles + 270 miles = 340 miles
Therefore, the distance between A and B is 340 miles.

D) 997
E) 112[/INST]  Let's analyze the problem:
The sum of the digits of a three-digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109.
From the problem statement, we know that if we subtract 495 from the number, we will get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.
So, let's start by writing the number in its standard form:
$$100x$$
Since the sum of the digits is 17, we know that the digit in the ones place is 1. Therefore, the number can be written as:
$$100x = 17$$
Now, we are given that the sum of the squares of the digits is 109. Let's calculate the squares of the digits:
$$\begin{aligned}
1^2 &= 1 \times 1 = 1 \\
2^2 &= 4 \times 2 = 8 \\
3^2 &= 9 \times 3 = 27

So, the sum of the squares of the digits is:
$$1 + 8 + 27 = 46$$
Subtracting 495 from the number:
$$100x - 495 = 100(46) - 495 = 434$$
Therefore, the number is 434.

D) None of these
E) Can not be determined[/INST]  To solve this problem, we are given two pieces of information:
1. The difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000.
2. The sum of the numbers is 1000.
We can use the fact that the square of a number is equal to the number times itself, so if the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000, then the squares of the two numbers must be 256000 apart.
Let's call the larger number x. Then the square of the larger number is x^2, and the square of the smaller number is x^2 - 256000.
We are also given that the sum of the two numbers is 1000, so we can write:
x + (x^2 - 256000) = 1000
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x + 256000 = 1000
Subtracting 256000 from both sides gives us:
2x = 750
Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
x = 375
So, the larger number is 375.
Therefore, the answer is (B) 628.",B

The organization decided to raise Rs 6 lakh by collecting equal contributions from each of its employees.
If each of them had contributed Rs 60 extra, the contribution would have been Rs 6.24 lakh.
So, the total contribution of all the employees is:
Rs 6 lakh + (Rs 60 x number of employees) = Rs 6.24 lakh
We are given that the contribution would have been Rs 6.24 lakh if each employee had contributed Rs 60 extra, so:
Rs 6.24 lakh = (Rs 6 lakh + (Rs 60 x number of employees))
Now, we can solve for the number of employees:
Rs 6.24 lakh = (Rs 6 lakh + (Rs 60 x number of employees))
Rs 60 = (Rs 6 lakh / number of employees) + Rs 60
Rs 60 = (Rs 6 lakh / number of employees)
Number of employees = Rs 6 lakh / Rs 60 = 100
So, there are 100 employees in the organization.

Answer Choices:
A) 4
B) 3
C) 2
D) 1
E) 0[/INST]  Let's analyze the problem:
The coin diver got $3.40 after one dive, which means she got a total of 340 cents.
From the problem statement, we know that she gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.
So, if she brought $3.40, she must have brought a combination of copper and brass coins such that the total value of the coins she brought is equal to $3.40.
Let's assume that the number of copper coins she brought is x. Since she gets 20 cents for each copper coin, the total value of the copper coins she brought is 20x cents.
Since she also gets 25 cents for each brass coin, the total value of the brass coins she brought is 25y cents, where y is a positive integer.
The problem statement tells us that the total value of the coins she brought is equal to $3.40, which means that:
20x + 25y = 340
Solving for x and y, we get:
x = 4
y = 3
So, the coin diver brought 4 copper coins and 3 brass coins. Therefore, the answer is (B) 3.",C

Answer Choices:
A) 700 meters
B) 1000 meters
C) 700 kilometers
D) 555 meters
E) 600 meters[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative motion, which is the speed and direction of one object relative to another. In this case, Ram and Krishna are traveling towards each other along the same route, so their relative speed is the difference between their speeds.
Ram is traveling at a speed of 20 m/s, and Krishna is traveling at a speed of 40 m/s, so their relative speed is:
Relative speed = 40 m/s - 20 m/s = 20 m/s
Now, we need to find the time it takes for Ram to meet Krishna. We are given that it takes 10 seconds for Ram to meet Krishna, so we can use this time to find the distance traveled by Ram:
Distance = Speed x Time = 20 m/s x 10 s = 200 meters
Now, we need to find the distance traveled by Krishna. Since they are traveling towards each other, their relative distance is the distance traveled by Krishna minus the distance traveled by Ram:
Relative distance = Distance traveled by Krishna - Distance traveled by Ram
= 40 m/s x 10 s - 200 meters
= 300 meters
So, the total distance between A and B is:
Total distance = Distance traveled by Ram + Relative distance = 200 meters + 300 meters = 500 meters
Therefore, the answer is (D) 555 meters.",E

E) None of these[/INST]  To find the difference in the speed of the two cars, we need to divide the distance covered by each car by the time taken to cover that distance.
For car 'X', the distance covered is 320 kms, and the time taken is 8 hours, so the speed is:
Speed of car 'X' = Distance / Time = 320 km / 8 hrs = 40 km/hr
For car 'Y', the distance covered is 415 kms, and the time taken is 5 hours, so the speed is:
Speed of car 'Y' = Distance / Time = 415 km / 5 hrs = 83 km/hr
So, the difference in the speed of the two cars is:
Difference in speed = Speed of car 'Y' - Speed of car 'X' = 83 km/hr - 40 km/hr = 43 km/hr
Therefore, the answer is (C) 43 kms / hr.",C

Answer Choices:
A) 9
B) 6
C) 4
D) 3
E) 2[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of average speed. The average speed of Winson's journey is the total distance traveled divided by the time taken.
Let's first calculate the distance traveled by Winson during the first part of his journey from his home to school:
Distance = Speed x Time = 10 miles/hour x 1 hour = 10 miles
Now, let's calculate the distance traveled by Winson during the second part of his journey from school to home:
Distance = Speed x Time = 5 miles/hour x 1 hour = 5 miles
So, the total distance traveled by Winson is the sum of the distances traveled during the two parts of his journey:
Total distance = Distance 1 + Distance 2 = 10 miles + 5 miles = 15 miles
Now, we can use the information given in the problem to find out how many miles his home is from his school:
Home distance = Total distance / 2 = 15 miles / 2 = 7.5 miles

Answer Choices:
A) 12 metre
B) 12.5 metre
C) 13.5 metre
D) 14 metre
E) 15 metre[/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The shadow of the flagstaff is 40.25 meters long, and the height of the building is 17.5 meters.
We can draw a triangle with the flagstaff as the base and the shadow as the height. The height of the building can also be drawn as a triangle with the base as the shadow and the height as the distance from the base to the top of the building.
Since the triangles are similar, we can use the ratio of their corresponding sides to find the height of the building.
The ratio of the length of the shadow to the height of the flagstaff is 40.25:17.5 = 2:1.
So, the ratio of the length of the shadow to the height of the building is 2:1, or 2/3.
Therefore, the height of the building is 2/3 x 17.5 = 12.5 meters.
So, the answer is (B) 12.5 meters.",B

B) 62.5 %
C) 63.5 %
D) 64.5 %
E) 65.5 %[/INST]  To find the new expenditure of the man if his income increases by 20%, we need to use the formula:
New expenditure = Old expenditure x (1 + Increase in income)
Given that the man spends 70% of his income, his old expenditure is:
Old expenditure = Income x 70%
Substituting the value of income from the problem, we get:
Old expenditure = 100 x 70%
Old expenditure = 70
Now, if the man's income increases by 20%, his new income is:
New income = Old income + Increase in income
New income = 100 + 20% of 100
New income = 120
Now, we can use the formula again to find the new expenditure:
New expenditure = Old expenditure x (1 + Increase in income)
New expenditure = 70 x (1 + 20%)
New expenditure = 70 x 1.20
New expenditure = 84

Answer Choices:
A) 45
B) 48
C) 51
D) 54
E) 57[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative motion, which is the speed and direction of movement of two objects relative to each other.
Ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm/hour, and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm/hour. To find the distance that ant A travels until meeting ant B, we need to use the formula:
distance = speed x time
We know that the distance between the farms is 75 cm, so we can plug in the values we know into the formula:
distance = 9 cm/hour x time + 75 cm
We also know that ant B is moving in the same direction as ant A, so we can assume that their relative motion is the same. Therefore, we can use the same speed value for both ants.
Now, we need to solve for the time. We know that ant A is moving at a speed of 9 cm/hour, and ant B is moving at a speed of 6 cm/hour. We can use the formula:
time = distance / speed
Plugging in the values we know, we get:
time = 75 cm / (9 cm/hour + 6 cm/hour)
Simplifying the formula, we get:
time = 75 cm / 15 cm/hour
time = 5 hours
Therefore, ant A will travel a distance of 75 cm in 5 hours until meeting ant B. The correct answer is (D) 54 cm.",A

Answer Choices:
A) 144 km
B) 72 km
C) 126 km
D) 84 km
E) 48 km[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative motion. Let's call the distance between X and Y as ""d"".
Allen starts from X and goes to Y at a speed of 54 kmph, so the time taken by him to reach Y is:
Time taken by Allen = Distance / Speed = d / 54 kmph
Now, Bob starts from Y and goes towards X at a speed of 78 kmph. So, the time taken by him to reach X is:
Time taken by Bob = Distance / Speed = d / 78 kmph
Since Allen changes his direction and returns to X after reaching Y, the time taken by him to return to X is:
Time taken by Allen = Distance / Speed = d / 54 kmph
Now, Bob reaches X after meeting Allen for the second time. So, the time taken by him to reach X is:
Time taken by Bob = Distance / Speed = d / 78 kmph
Now, we need to find the distance between X and Y. Let's call the distance between X and Y as ""d"".
We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, so the distance covered by Bob is:
Distance covered by Bob = d + 48 km
Now, we can use the above equations to find the value of ""d"":
d = Time taken by Allen x Speed of Allen
= 54 kmph x Time taken by Allen
= d / 54 kmph
Substituting the value of d from the above equation, we get:
d = 126 km
So, the distance between X and Y is 126 km.

From the information provided, we can see that Fernando has 3 lunches and 3 dinners per week, for a total of 6 meals. Since the cafeteria is closed on weekends, Fernando will not be able to use his meals on those days. Therefore, he has 6 - 2 = 4 meals available for the week.
Now, let's consider the different ways Fernando can allocate his 4 meals:
Option A: 5 C 3 * 4 C 3
This option allows Fernando to use 5 lunches and 3 dinners, for a total of 8 meals. However, since he only has 4 meals available, this option is not possible.
Option B: 5 C 4 * 4 C 2
This option allows Fernando to use 5 lunches and 4 dinners, for a total of 8 meals. However, since he only has 4 meals available, this option is not possible.
Option C: 5 C 2 * 4 C 4
This option allows Fernando to use 5 lunches and 2 dinners, for a total of 6 meals. However, since he only has 4 meals available, this option is not possible.
Option D: 5 C 6 * 4 C 5
This option allows Fernando to use 5 lunches and 6 dinners, for a total of 11 meals. However, since he only has 4 meals available, this option is not possible.
Option E: 4 C 3 * 4 C 3
This option allows Fernando to use 4 lunches and 3 dinners, for a total of 7 meals. This is the only option that is possible, as it aligns with the information provided.
Therefore, the answer is Option E: 4 C 3 * 4 C 3.",A

Answer Choices:
A) 60
B) 56
C) 51
D) 61
E) 41[/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use the information given in the question:

A number is as much greater than 36 as is less than 86.
Let's call the number x.
We know that x - 36 is equal to the number of years that the number is greater than 36.
So, x - 36 = y, where y is the number of years that the number is less than 86.
We can simplify the equation by adding 36 to both sides:
x = 86 + y
Now, we can solve for y:
y = 86 - x
Now, we can substitute the value of x from the given options:
A) 60: y = 26
B) 56: y = 30
C) 51: y = 35

186,"[INST]An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long .
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour , how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
Answer Choices:
A) 43 seconds
B) 39 seconds
C) 20 seconds
D) 33 seconds
E) 55 seconds[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
We are given that the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which is 1 mile long. So, the distance the train travels in 3 seconds is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 1 mile / 3 seconds = 0.33 miles
Now, we need to find the speed of the train as it travels through the tunnel. We are given that the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour. To find the speed of the train in the tunnel, we can use the formula:
Speed in tunnel = Speed outside tunnel x (Tunnel length / Total distance)
We are given that the tunnel is 1 mile long, so the total distance the train travels is:
Total distance = Distance in tunnel + Distance outside tunnel = 1 mile + 0.33 miles = 1.33 miles
Now, we can plug in the values we have found into the formula:
Speed in tunnel = Speed outside tunnel x (Tunnel length / Total distance) = 120 miles/hour x (1 mile / 1.33 miles) = 90 miles/hour
So, the train travels at a speed of 90 miles per hour through the tunnel. To find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Speed
We are given that the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, and it takes 90 miles per hour to pass through the tunnel. So, the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is:
Time = 0.33 miles / 90 miles/hour = 0.00375 hours = 0.0375 minutes
Therefore, the answer is (D) 33 seconds.",D
187,"[INST]A merchant receives an invoice for a motor boat for $ 20 000 with terms 4 / 30 , n / 100 . What is the highest simple interest rate at which he can afford to borrow money in order to take advantage of the discount ?
Answer Choices:
A) 247.67
B) 237.67
C) 227.67
D) 215.67
E) None of these[/INST]  To determine the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to calculate the present value of the invoice using the given terms.
The invoice is for $20,000, with a payment term of 4/30, which means the merchant has 4 months to pay the bill. The discount rate is 1/100, which means the merchant will receive a discount of 1% if they pay the bill within 100 days.
To calculate the present value of the invoice, we can use the formula:
Present Value = Future Value / (1 + Interest Rate)^Number of Payments
In this case, the future value is $20,000, and the number of payments is 4 months. The interest rate is 1/100, or 1%.
So, the present value of the invoice is:
$20,000 / (1 + 0.01)^4 = $18,333.33
The highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money is the rate at which the present value of the invoice is equal to the amount of money they want to borrow. In this case, that rate is:
$18,333.33 / $20,000 = 0.915, or 91.5%

Answer Choices:
A) Rs . 6
B) Rs . 7.2
C) Rs . 5.6
D) Rs . 8
E) None of these[/INST]  To find the manufactured cost of each pen, we need to use the information provided in the question.
The company produces very fine quality of writing pens, and on average, 10% of the produced pens are always defective and rejected before packing. The company promises to deliver 7200 pens to its wholesaler at Rs. 10 each. The overall profit on all the manufactured pens is estimated to be 25%.
From the given information, we can calculate the total number of pens that the company will produce:
Total number of pens = 7200 (delivered to wholesaler) / 0.9 (as 10% are defective and rejected) = 8000 pens
Now, we can calculate the manufactured cost of each pen:
Manufactured cost of each pen = Total number of pens x Profit percentage = 8000 pens x 25% = Rs. 2000
So, the manufactured cost of each pen is Rs. 2000.
Therefore, the answer is (C) Rs. 5.6.",B
192,"[INST]A two digit number exceeds the sum of the digits of that number by 18 . If the digit at the unit ' s place is double the digit in the ten ' s place , what is the number ?
Answer Choices:
A) 12
B) 24
C) 42
D) 48
E) 49[/INST]  Let's break this problem down:
The number is a two-digit number, so it can be written in the form $ab$, where $a$ is the digit in the tens place and $b$ is the digit in the units place.
The problem states that the number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18. So, we can write:
$ab + ab = 18$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$2ab = 18$
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$a + a = 9$
Since the digit in the units place is double the digit in the tens place, we can write:
$b = 2a$
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
$2a + 2a = 18$
Simplifying, we get:
$4a = 18$
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
$a = 4$
So, the number is 42.
Therefore, the answer is (C) 42.",B

E) None[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $L(x,y)$ and $R(x,y)$ and then determine which of the options is true.
Let $x,y$ be positive real numbers. Then,
$$L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = \max\left\{x,y,x+y\right\}$$
$$R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = \max\left\{2x,2y,2x+2y\right\}$$
Now, let's check each option:
A) $L(x,y) = R(x,y)$
$$L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [x] + [y] + [2x+2y] = R(x,y)$$
So, the answer is A: $L(x,y) = R(x,y)$.
B) $L(x,y) \neq R(x,y)$
Let $x = 1$ and $y = 2$. Then,
$$L(1,2) = [1] + [2] + [3] = 3 > R(1,2) = [2] + [4] = 6$$
So, the answer is B: $L(x,y) \neq R(x,y)$.
C) $L(x,y) < R(x,y)$
Let $x = 1$ and $y = 2$. Then,
$$L(1,2) = [1] + [2] + [3] = 3 < R(1,2) = [2] + [4] = 6$$
So, the answer is C: $L(x,y) < R(x,y)$.
D) $L(x,y) > R(x,y)$
Let $x = 2$ and $y = 1$. Then,
$$L(2,1) = [2] + [1] + [3] = 4 > R(2,1) = [1] + [2] = 3$$

195,"[INST]An electric pole , 14 metres high , casts a shadow of 10 metres . Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions .
Answer Choices:
A) 21
B) 22
C) 20
D) 23
E) 24[/INST]  To solve this problem, we can use the concept of similar triangles. The shadow of the electric pole is proportional to the height of the pole. Since the shadow of the pole is 10 meters long, the height of the pole must be 14 meters / 10 = 1.4 meters.
Now, we can use the same proportion to find the height of the tree. The shadow of the tree is proportional to the height of the tree. So, if the shadow of the pole is 10 meters long, the shadow of the tree must be 15 meters / 10 = 1.5 meters longer than the height of the pole.
Therefore, the height of the tree is 1.5 meters + 1.4 meters = 2.9 meters.
So, the answer is (D) 23 meters.",A

B) ( ab − ay) / 2
C) ( by − ay) / 2
D) ( ay + by) / x
E) ( a − b) / 2 y[/INST]  To find the area of the triangle, we need to use the formula:
Area = (base × height) / 2
In this case, the base of the triangle is (x - a) and the height is (y - b).
So, the area of the triangle is:
Area = (x - a) × (y - b) / 2
Now, we need to choose the correct answer from the options given.
A) (ay - by) / 2
B) (ab - ay) / 2
C) (by - ay) / 2
D) (ay + by) / x
E) (a - b) / 2y

We can simplify the formula by using the values given in the problem:
x - a = b - a
y - b = y - b
So, the area of the triangle is:
Area = (b - a) × (y - b) / 2
= (b - a) × (y - b) / 2
= (b × y - b × a) / 2
= (y - a) × (y - b) / 2
= (y - a)²
Therefore, the correct answer is (E) (a - b) / 2y.",C

Alan's probability of answering correctly without cheating is 1/5, since he randomly guessed the answer.
Roger's probability of answering correctly without cheating is 2/3, since he looked at the paper of the student in front of him, but did not cheat.
Peter's probability of answering correctly without cheating is 5/6, since he performed the calculations and marked the answer correctly.
So, the probability of the question being answered correctly, but not via cheating, is:
Probability of Alan answering correctly without cheating = 1/5
Probability of Roger answering correctly without cheating = 2/3

Answer Choices:
A) 50
B) 70
C) 75
D) 100
E) 125[/INST]  Let's break down the information given in the problem:
* All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both.
* The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.
* 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.
From the second statement, we can deduce that the number of files infected by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. So, the number of files infected by a worm is:
2.5 x (250 - 50) = 2.5 x 200 = 500
Since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, the number of files that were not infected by a worm is:
250 - 50 = 200

A) y / ( 1200 xy)
B) 20 xy / w
C) 5 xy / ( 12 w)
D) w / ( 3 xy)
E) 3 y / ( wx)[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula:
Time = Rate x Distance
Where:
Time = the time it takes for the liquid to pass through the drain
Rate = the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain (in gallons per second)
Distance = the volume of the liquid (in gallons)
In this case, the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is given as w/25 gallons per second, and the volume of the liquid is given as y gallons.
So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:
Time = Rate x Distance
Time = (w/25) x y
Now, we are asked to choose the correct answer from the options given. The options are:
A) y / (1200 xy)
B) 20 xy / w
C) 5 xy / (12w)

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver , what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum ?
Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the problem:
* The coin made of alloy of aluminum and silver measures 2 x 15 mm (it is 2 mm thick and its diameter is 15 mm).
* The weight of the coin is 30 grams.
* The volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver.
From the information given, we can calculate the volume of the coin:
Volume of coin = π x (diameter/2)^2 x thickness
= π x (15 mm/2)^2 x 2 mm
= 37.8 mm^3
Since the alloy is made of equal parts of aluminum and silver, the weight of the coin can be calculated as:
Weight of coin = weight of aluminum + weight of silver
= (37.8 mm^3 x density of aluminum) + (37.8 mm^3 x density of silver)
where density of aluminum is approximately 2.7 g/cm^3 and density of silver is approximately 10.5 g/cm^3.
Now, if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum will be:
Weight of coin = weight of aluminum + (2 x weight of silver)
= (37.8 mm^3 x density of aluminum) + (37.8 mm^3 x (2 x density of silver))
= 37.8 mm^3 x density of aluminum + 75.6 mm^3 x density of silver
= 75.6 mm^3 x density of aluminum + 151.2 mm^3 x density of silver
= 2266.8 g + 302.4 g
= 529 g
Therefore, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum is:
B) 529 grams.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 100
B) 160
C) 150
D) 210
E) 220[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to follow the given conditions:
10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number, and the result is equal to the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number.
Let's break down the problem:
2/3 of a number = 6/3 = 2
Now, 10 is subtracted from 2, which gives us:
2 - 10 = -8
So, the result of 10 being subtracted from 2/3 of a number is -8.
Now, we are asked to find the number. We can do this by using the information given in the problem:
The sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number is equal to the result of 10 being subtracted from 2/3 of the number.
So, we can set up the equation:
40 + 1/3 of the number = -8
To solve for the number, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3:
120 = -8
Now, we can divide both sides of the equation by -8:
15 = -
So, the number is 15.

Answer Choices:
A) 9 hours .
B) 10 hours .
C) 11 hours .
D) 12 hours .
E) 13 hours .[/INST]  To find out how many hours it will take Shweta to cover 100 km, we need to calculate the total distance she will cover and then divide it by her rate of travel.
Let's break down the problem:
1. Shweta rides at a rate of 10 km per hour, so she covers 10 km in 1 hour.
2. She stops for 10 minutes at the end of every 15 km, so she covers 5 km in 1 hour (10 km / 2 stops = 5 km per hour).
3. To cover 100 km, Shweta will make 7 stops (100 km / 15 km per stop = 7 stops).
Now, let's calculate the total time it will take her to cover 100 km:
Total distance = 100 km
Rate of travel = 10 km/hour (during riding) + 5 km/hour (during rest stops) = 15 km/hour
Total time = Total distance / Rate of travel = 100 km / 15 km/hour = 6.67 hours (round up to 7 hours)
So, Shweta will take approximately 7 hours to cover 100 km.

* The dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl at each feeding session.
We can use this information to calculate the amount of food left in the bowl at each hour:
8:00 am: 100% of the food remaining in the bowl (initial amount)
9:00 am: 75% of the initial amount (100% - 1/3 of the initial amount)
10:00 am: 50% of the initial amount (75% - 1/3 of the initial amount)
11:00 am: 33% of the initial amount (50% - 1/3 of the initial amount)

Answer Choices:
A) 0.5
B) 1
C) 1.25
D) 1.5
E) 2[/INST]  To find out how many additional gallons of orange juice must be mixed to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to calculate the percentage of orange juice in the soft drink after mixing the additional orange juice.
Let's start by finding the percentage of orange juice in the soft drink after mixing 1 gallon of additional orange juice:
Soft drink contains 40% orange juice and 60% water, so:
Soft drink = 40% orange juice + 60% water = 100%
Now, let's mix 1 gallon of additional orange juice with the soft drink:
New soft drink = 40% orange juice + 60% water + 1 gallon of additional orange juice = 100%
To find the percentage of orange juice in the new soft drink, we can use the same formula:
Percentage of orange juice = (40% + 1 gallon of additional orange juice) / (40% + 60% + 1 gallon of additional orange juice) x 100%
= (40 + 1) / (40 + 60 + 1) x 100%
= 50%
So, to make the orange juice 60% of the soft drink, we need to mix an additional 0.5 gallons of orange juice (since 60% is equal to 0.6 x 40%, where 40% is the percentage of orange juice in the soft drink after mixing the additional orange juice).

Answer Choices:
A) 5 / 7
B) 3 / 5
C) 4 / 7
D) 2 / 5
E) 2 / 7[/INST]  To determine the probability that a number chosen from $S = \{1, 2, ..., 1000\}$ is relatively prime to $1000$, we can use the fact that two numbers are relatively prime if and only if their greatest common divisor (gcd) is 1.
Let $n$ be a random integer chosen from $S$. Then, the gcd of $n$ and $1000$ is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $nk \equiv 0 \mod 1000$.
Since $S$ contains the numbers from $1$ to $1000$, the gcd of $n$ and $1000$ is either $1$ or a positive integer between $2$ and $1000$.
Therefore, the probability that $n$ is relatively prime to $1000$ is:
$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1011}{2} = \frac{1011}{4}$$

000[/INST]  To find the amount of money that Charles originally invested, we can use the formula for compound interest:
A = P x (1 + r)^n
Where:
A = amount of money at the end of the investment period (in this case, $54,080)
P = principal amount (the amount originally invested)
r = annual interest rate (8% in this case)
n = number of years the money was invested (1 year in this case)

Substituting the values given in the problem, we get:
A = $54,080
P = ?
Solving for P, we get:
P = $54,080 x (1 + 0.08)^1
P = $45,000

Therefore, the amount of money that Charles originally invested is $45,000.

Answer Choices:
A) 45
B) 48
C) 50
D) 55
E) 58[/INST]  Let's analyze the given information:
1. Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100
Given: Joe's age = x
Joe's sister's age = y
Joe's father's age = z
From the first equation, we get:
x + y + z = 100
2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
So, when Joe is x years old, his sister will be 2x years old.
3. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
So, when Joe's father is x years old, Joe's sister was y years old.
Now, we can solve the system of equations:
x + y + z = 100 ... (1)
x = 45 ... (2)
y = 2(45) = 90 ... (3)
z = 2(45) = 90 ... (4)
Now, we can find the age of Joe's father:
From (1), we have x = 45.
From (2), we have y = 90.
From (3), we have z = 90.
So, Joe's father is 45 + 90 + 90 = 285 years old.
Therefore, the answer is (D) 55.",C

E) 5000 / y[/INST]  To find the percentage of x in terms of y, we can use the given information:
x = m% of 4y
x = 0.06y (since m = 0.06)
Now, we can use the formula for percentages:
Percentage = (Part / Whole) × 100
In this case, the part (x) is 0.06y, and the whole (y) is 4y.
So, the percentage of x in terms of y is:
Percentage of x = (0.06y / 4y) × 100 = 15%

To find the time it takes the worker to cycle from home to work, we can use the formula:
Time = Distance / Rate
We are given that the distance between the worker's home and work is 20 kilometers. So, to find the time it takes the worker to cycle from home to work, we can divide the distance by the cycling rate:

Answer Choices:
A) 4
B) 5
C) 6
D) 7
E) 8[/INST]  To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the passage:
* If P had eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar.
* If Q had eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar.
Since both P and Q are eating simultaneously, we can use the concept of ""division of time"" to find out how long it would take them to empty the jar.
Let's assume that P and Q are eating at the same rate, so their combined rate is equal to the rate at which P would have eaten alone. Therefore, the time it would take them to empty the jar is:
Time = Total amount of candy / Rate of eating
In this case, the total amount of candy in the jar is 100 (since the jar is full), and the rate of eating is 10 (since P would have eaten alone in 10 minutes).
So, the time it would take P and Q to empty the jar is:
Time = 100 / 10 = 10 minutes
