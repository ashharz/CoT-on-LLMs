The top of the tower is observed from the car and , in the process , it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45 ° to 60 ° . After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower ?
Answer Choices:
A) 5 ( √ 3 + 1)
B) 6 ( √ 3 + √ 2)
C) 7 ( √ 3 – 1)
D) 8 ( √ 3 – 2)
E) None of these[/INST]A: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of similar triangles. The angle of elevation is increasing from 45° to 60°, which means that the triangle formed by the car, the tower, and the line of sight is becoming more acute.
The height of the tower is given as x, and the distance between the car and the base of the tower is also x.
Using the concept of similar triangles, we can find the ratio of the height of the tower to the distance between the car and the base of the tower:
tan(45°) = x / (x - 10)
Simplifying, we get:
x = 10 + 10 tan(60° - 45°)
x = 10 + 10(2/3) = 10 + 6 = 16
So, the car will reach the base of the tower in 16 minutes.

Answer Choices:
A) $ 61
B) $ 65
C) $ 67.40
D) $ 70
E) $ 78.20[/INST]A: To find the original price of the item, we can use the information given in the problem:
The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item. This means that the original price of the item is half of the price the customer paid, plus $1.90.
So, the original price of the item = $1.90 + (half of the price the customer paid)
We are given that the customer paid $20 - off, which means that the customer paid $20 - 1.90 = $18.10 for the item.

Answer Choices:
A) 0.22
B) 0.26
C) 0.37
D) 0.46
E) 0.63[/INST]A: To find the greatest value for the probability that neither of the two events will occur, we need to find the probability of the complement of the event that either Stock A or Stock B will increase in value during the next month.
The probability of Stock A increasing in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability of Stock B increasing in value during the next month is 0.74.
The complement of the event that Stock A increases in value during the next month is the event that Stock A does not increase in value during the next month. The probability of this event is:
P(Stock A does not increase in value) = 1 - P(Stock A increases in value) = 1 - 0.56 = 0.44
Similarly, the probability of the complement of the event that Stock B increases in value during the next month is:
P(Stock B does not increase in value) = 1 - P(Stock B increases in value) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.
Now, we need to find the greatest value of the probability of neither of these events occurring. This is the probability of the intersection of the two events, which is the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases in value during the next month.
The probability of the intersection of the two events is:
P(Neither Stock A nor Stock B increases in value) = P(Stock A does not increase in value) ∩ P(Stock B does not increase in value)
= 0.44 ∩ 0.26 = 0.11
So, the greatest value for the probability that neither of the two events will occur is 0.11, which is option B.",B

Then , another 20 marbles were pulled out , of which 1 was black , after which they were all returned to the bag . If the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag , how many marbles in total Q does the bag currently hold ?
Answer Choices:
A) 40
B) 200
C) 380
D) 400
E) 3200[/INST]A: Let's analyze the problem:
The first time 20 marbles were pulled out of the bag, and 1 of them was black, so the percentage of black marbles in the first group is 1/20 = 0.05.
The second time 20 marbles were pulled out, and 1 of them was black, so the percentage of black marbles in the second group is 1/20 = 0.05 again.
Since the marbles are returned to the bag, the total number of marbles in the bag is the sum of the number of marbles in the first group and the number of marbles in the second group.
The first group had 20 marbles, and 1 of them was black, so the total number of marbles in the first group is 20 + 1 = 21.
The second group had 20 marbles, and 1 of them was black, so the total number of marbles in the second group is 20 + 1 = 21.
Therefore, the total number of marbles in the bag is 21 + 21 = 42 marbles.

The train covers a quarter of the distance in 10 hours, so it takes 10/4 = 2.5 hours to cover the remaining distance.
Now, the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles/hour, so it takes:
Time = Distance / Speed

Answer Choices:
A) 27
B) 81
C) 90
D) 99
E) 110[/INST]A: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:
At least 45% of the 200 students attended the prom night, so the number of students who attended the prom night is 45/100 = 45.
At least 35% of the students took part in the debating session, so the number of students who took part in the debating session is 35/100 = 35.
Since the total number of students is 200, we can set up the following equation:
45 + 35 = 100
So, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session is:
100 - (45 + 35) = 100 - 70 = 30.

Answer Choices:
A) 226
B) 230
C) 240
D) 260
E) 280[/INST]A: To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the revenue from sales and subtract the production costs.
Revenue = Number of components x Selling price per component
= 420 units/month x $110/component
= $46,800/month
Production Costs = Number of components x Production Cost per component
= 420 units/month x $110/component
= $4,680/month
Yearly Profit = Revenue - Production Costs
= $46,800/month x 12 months
= $561,600
To guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, the selling price per component must be at least:
$626,400 / $561,600 = 112% of the selling price
So, the minimum selling price per component is:

We also know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, which means that 2% of 720 is equal to 14.4 (rounded to the nearest whole number).
So, the total number of staplers produced on Monday is:
720 (defective staplers) + 14.4 (non-defective staplers rejected by mistake) = 734.4
Since we can't have a fraction of a stapler, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 740 staplers produced on Monday.

We are given that P(A) = 0.2 and P(B) = 0.8.
Now, we need to find P(A ∩ B), which is the intersection of A and B. Since A and B are events, their intersection is also an event.
P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B) = 0.2 x 0.8 = 0.16

What is the distance travelled by the jeep ?
Answer Choices:
A) 126 km
B) 144 km
C) 127 km
D) 228 km
E) 128 km[/INST]A: To find the distance traveled by the jeep, we need to use the information given in the problem.
The jeep traveled a certain distance in 6 hours in the forward journey, so its speed was:
Speed = Distance / Time = 126 km / 6 hours = 21 km/hour
During the return journey, the jeep increased its speed by 12 km/hour, so its new speed is:
New Speed = Old Speed + Change in Speed = 21 km/hour + 12 km/hour = 33 km/hour
Now, we need to find the time taken to travel the distance at this new speed:
Time = Distance / New Speed = 126 km / 33 km/hour = 4 hours
So, the distance traveled by the jeep is:
Distance = Time x New Speed = 4 hours x 33 km/hour = 128 km

Answer Choices:
A) 20 %
B) 28 %
C) 36 %
D) 40 %
E) 42 %[/INST]A: If the original retail price of an appliance was 60 percent more than its wholesale cost, then the wholesale cost was:
60 / 100 = $X
If the appliance was sold for 20 percent less than the original retail price, then the appliance was sold for:
$X - (20 / 100) = $Y
Now, we need to find the percentage increase over the wholesale cost:
(Y - X) / X = (20 / 100)
Solving for Y, we get:
Y = $X + (20 / 100)X = $X + $20
So, the appliance was sold for $X + $20, which is 28 percent more than its wholesale cost. The answer is B.",B

Find the area of the sheet .
Answer Choices:
A) 1584
B) 1120
C) 792
D) 1320
E) 1200[/INST]A: To find the area of the sheet, we need to find the perimeter of each half and then multiply it by the length of the sheet.
For the first set of sides, the perimeter is 48 cm, and the length of the sheet is unknown. So, we can set up the equation:
Perimeter = 2(length)
Solving for the length, we get:
Length = Perimeter / 2 = 48 / 2 = 24 cm
For the second set of sides, the perimeter is 66 cm, and the length of the sheet is unknown. So, we can set up the equation:
Perimeter = 2(length)
Solving for the length, we get:
Length = Perimeter / 2 = 66 / 2 = 33 cm
Now, we have the area of each half:
Half 1: Area = Length x Width = 24 x Width
Half 2: Area = Length x Width = 33 x Width
Since the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the total area of the sheet is the sum of the areas of the two halves:
Total Area = Area of Half 1 + Area of Half 2 = 24 x Width + 33 x Width = 57 x Width
Now, we need to find the width of the sheet. Let's assume the width of the sheet is x cm.
Substituting x into the equation above, we get:
Total Area = 57x
So, the area of the sheet is 57x cm.

A) 13.3542
B) 15.8113
C) 18.3451
D) 19.5667
E) 20.8888[/INST]A: To find the diameter of the sphere, we need to find the radius of the sphere that the rectangular solid is inscribed in. Since all eight vertices of the rectangular solid are on the sphere, the radius of the sphere must be the distance between any two vertices.
Let's choose two vertices, A and B, and measure the distance between them. Let's call this distance d.
Since the rectangular solid is 3x4x15, the distance between vertex A and vertex B must be the same as the distance between vertex B and vertex C, and the distance between vertex C and vertex A. Therefore, we can write:
d = distance between A and B = distance between B and C = distance between C and A
Now, we know that the volume of the rectangular solid is 3x4x15 = 120, so the volume of the sphere is also 120. Since the sphere is inscribed in the rectangular solid, the radius of the sphere must be half of the length of the height of the rectangular solid.
The height of the rectangular solid is 4x15 = 60, so the radius of the sphere is half of 60, or 30.
Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2x30 = 60.

Then, he gives a discount of 7% on the already discounted price, which means he sells the watch for Rs. 95 x (1 - 0.07) = Rs. 88.50.
So, the profit he earns is Rs. 88.50 - Rs. 95 = Rs. 6.50.

Answer Choices:
A) 384
B) 562
C) 458
D) 156
E) 452[/INST]A: To find the average speed of the plane around the field, we need to find the total distance flown by the plane and divide it by the number of sides of the field.
Let's assume the sides of the field are of equal length.
The distance flown by the plane along each side is:
Side 1: 200 km/hr x 4 sides = 800 km
Side 2: 400 km/hr x 4 sides = 1600 km
Side 3: 600 km/hr x 4 sides = 2400 km
Side 4: 800 km/hr x 4 sides = 3200 km
Total distance flown by the plane = 800 + 1600 + 2400 + 3200 = 8000 km
Now, let's find the average speed of the plane around the field:
Average speed = Total distance / Number of sides
= 8000 km / 4 sides
= 2000 km/hr

D) 5
6
E) 11
12[/INST]A: Let's break down the information given in the problem:
Jack buys 18 sharpeners (white and brown) for Rs. 100.
He pays 1 rupee more for each white sharpeners than brown sharpeners.
So, if he buys x white sharpeners, he pays Rs. 100 + (1 x Rs. 1) = Rs. 100 + Rs. 1 = Rs. 101 for x white sharpeners.
Similarly, he buys y brown sharpeners, and he pays Rs. 100 + (1 x Rs. 1) = Rs. 100 + Rs. 1 = Rs. 101 for y brown sharpeners.
We know that the total amount he paid is Rs. 100, so the sum of the cost of white and brown sharpeners is equal to the total amount he paid:
101 + 101 = 202
Now, we can solve for x and y:
x + y = 18 (since he bought 18 sharpeners in total)
101x + 101y = 202 (since the total amount he paid is Rs. 202)
Now, we can solve for x and y:
x = 10 (since 10 white sharpeners cost Rs. 100 + Rs. 1 = Rs. 101)
y = 8 (since 8 brown sharpeners cost Rs. 100 + Rs. 1 = Rs. 101)
So, Jack buys 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners.
The answer is (A) 10 and (B) 8.",A

How long after they begin will they meet ?
Answer Choices:
A) 1
B) 1.25
C) 1.50
D) 1.75
E) 2[/INST]A: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the two cars are moving relative to each other. The relative speed between the two cars is the difference between their speeds.
Let the speed of the first car be 12 mph, and the speed of the second car be 13 mph. The relative speed between the two cars is:
Relative speed = 13 mph - 12 mph = 1 mph
The distance between the two cars is 50 miles, which we can divide by the relative speed to find the time it takes for them to meet:
Time = Distance / Relative speed = 50 miles / 1 mph = 50 hours
So, the two cars will meet after 50 hours, or 2 days. The answer is E).",E

Answer Choices:
A) 30000
B) 415000
C) 31500

To find the required monthly sale, we can divide the desired monthly income of 6000 by the commission earned per month:
Required monthly sale = Desired monthly income / Commission earned per month
Required monthly sale = 6000 / 2250 = 27000
So, the servant needs to make a sale of 27000 Rupees to earn a monthly income of 6000 Rupees. The answer is B.",A

How many students are there in the class ?
Answer Choices:
A) 850
B) 800
C) 900
D) 950
E) 1000[/INST]A: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:
8% of total students are interested in Football, which means 8/100 = 0.08 of the total students are interested in Football.
4/5 of total students are interested in Cricket, which means 4/5 × 100 = 0.8 of the total students are interested in Cricket.
10% of total students are interested in Basketball, which means 10/100 = 0.1 of the total students are interested in Basketball.
Remaining 20 students are not interested in any games, which means 20/100 = 0.2 of the total students are not interested in any games.
Now, we need to find the total number of students in the class. We can do this by adding up the number of students interested in each sport:
Total number of students interested in Football = 0.08 × 100 = 8
Total number of students interested in Cricket = 0.8 × 100 = 80
Total number of students interested in Basketball = 0.1 × 100 = 10
Total number of students not interested in any games = 0.2 × 100 = 20
Now, we add up the total number of students interested in each sport to find the total number of students in the class:
Total number of students in the class = 8 + 80 + 10 + 20 = 118
So, there are 118 students in the class. The answer is (D) 950.",E

Answer Choices:
A) 22
B) 27
C) 29
D) Can not be determined
E) None of the above[/INST]A: Let's assume the ages of R, T, and Q are R, T, and Q, respectively. Since R is older than T, R's age is greater than T's age by some number x.
We know that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years, so:
R's age + T's age = 50
R's age = 50 - T's age
Now, we know that Q is younger than R, so Q's age is less than R's age by some number x.
Q's age = R's age - x
Now, we can substitute the values we know:
R's age = 50 - T's age
Q's age = R's age - x
Now, we can solve for x:
x = Q's age - R's age
x = 50 - T's age
x = 22
So, the difference between R and Q's age is 22 years. The answer is A.",D

E) 10.75 miles[/INST]A: To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile, we need to find the number of quarter-miles you can travel with $8.50.
A quarter-mile is equal to 0.25 miles, so $8.50 is equal to 3.4 quarter-miles (8.50 / 0.25 = 3.4).
So, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 3.4 quarter-miles, which is equal to 14.75 miles (3.4 quarter-miles x 4 quarter-miles per mile).
Therefore, the answer is (D) 14.75 miles.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 60 m
B) 61 m

D) 63 m
E) 64 m[/INST]A: To find the perimeter of the rectangular piece, we need to use the formula: Perimeter = 2(length + breadth + breadth + length).
Since the length is 1 m more than 4 times the breadth, we can write:
Length = 4B + 1
Now, we are given that the area of the piece is 150 sq m, so the breadth is:
B = 150 / 4 = 37.5 m
Now, we can find the perimeter:
Perimeter = 2(4B + 1 + 4B + 1) = 2(9B + 2) = 180 m
So, the perimeter of the rectangular piece is 180 m. The answer is B: 61 m.",C

If vitamins E and A are to be obtained from no other source , how many grams of the health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins ?
Answer Choices:
A) 8.5
B) 10.5
C) 12.5
D) 14.5
E) 16.5[/INST]A: To determine the number of grams of health food that must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to calculate the total amount of each vitamin in the daily intake.
From the problem statement, we know that:
* 1 gram of the health food contains 9% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E.
* 1 gram of the health food contains 8% of the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A.
To calculate the total amount of each vitamin in the daily intake, we can multiply the amount per gram by the number of grams consumed daily:
Vitamin E: 9% of minimum daily requirement per gram x number of grams consumed daily = 9% of minimum daily requirement x grams consumed daily
Vitamin A: 8% of minimum daily requirement per gram x number of grams consumed daily = 8% of minimum daily requirement x grams consumed daily
Now, we need to determine the minimum daily requirement of each vitamin. Let's assume that the minimum daily requirement of vitamin E is 10 mg and the minimum daily requirement of vitamin A is 20 mcg.
Vitamin E: 9% of minimum daily requirement per gram x number of grams consumed daily = 9% of 10 mg x grams consumed daily = 0.9 mg
Vitamin A: 8% of minimum daily requirement per gram x number of grams consumed daily = 8% of 20 mcg x grams consumed daily = 1.6 mcg
To provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins, we need to consume:
Vitamin E: 0.9 mg per day
Vitamin A: 1.6 mcg per day
Therefore, the answer is (B) 10.5 grams of health food must be eaten daily to provide at least the minimum daily requirement of both vitamins.",C

E) 19[/INST]A: To determine the number of helpers needed, we need to calculate the total number of cakes required and divide it by the number of helpers.
The problem states that 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes are needed.
A large cake takes 1 helper to prepare for 1 hour, so 20 large cakes require 20 helpers for 3 hours (3 x 2 = 6).
A small cake takes 35 helpers to prepare for 1 hour, so 700 small cakes require 700/35 = 20 helpers for 3 hours.
Therefore, the total number of helpers required is 20 + 20 = 40 helpers.

A) 12 / 25
B) 3 / 2
C) 3
D) 2
E) 25 / 3[/INST]A: Let's use the information given in the problem to find the answer.
We know that six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two rolls. So, if we divide the number of falafel in six pita breads by 2, we get the number of falafel in two rolls:
6 pita breads = 2 rolls
Falafel in 6 pita breads = Falafel in 2 rolls
Falafel in 2 rolls = x
Now, we are also given that three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes. So, if we divide the number of falafel in three rolls by 5, we get the number of falafel in one baguette:
Falafel in 3 rolls = x
Falafel in 1 baguette = 5x
Now, we want to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes. We can do this by dividing the number of falafel in two baguettes by the number of falafel in one baguette:
Falafel in 2 baguettes = 5x

Answer Choices:
A) 238
B) 289
C) 200
D) 287
E) 187[/INST]A: Let's use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the plane and the ship are moving relative to each other. If the plane has a speed of 10 times the speed of the ship, then the relative speed between the two is 10 x 180 = 1800 miles per hour.
The distance traveled by the ship is 180 miles, so the distance traveled by the plane is the same distance plus the time it took the plane to catch up with the ship. Since the plane has a speed of 10 times the speed of the ship, it will take it 10 times as long to catch up, or 1800 / 10 = 180 miles.
Therefore, the distance between the starting point and where they meet is 180 + 180 = 360 miles. The answer is A, 238 miles.",C

Answer Choices:
A) 300
B) 500
C) 5000
D) 6000
E) 7500[/INST]A: To find the total deer population in the forest, we need to use the information given in the problem.
The probability of a deer being caught and tagged in the second year is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, if the population of deer in the forest remained constant between 2001 and 2002.
So, the probability of a deer being caught and tagged in the second year is:
P = (20/500) = 0.04
The total number of deer caught in the second year is 500.
So, the total number of deer in the forest is:
Total deer population = (500/P) = (500/0.04) = 12500
Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 12500. The answer is E.",E

Answer Choices:
A) 20 %
B) 40 %
C) 50 %
D) 65 %
E) 75 %[/INST]A: If the population of Boomtown is expected to increase by 10% per year, then the population one year from now will be 1.1 times the current population (since 10% of the current population is added each year). Therefore, the population one year from now will be:
Population one year from now = Current population x 1.1
So, the population one year from now will be double the population of one year ago if the current population is x. Therefore, the percent increase in population over the last year is:
Percent increase = (Population one year from now / Population of one year ago) x 100
= (2x / x) x 100
= 100%

D) 42

E) 62
42[/INST]A: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:
Arjun has $x dollars, and Sajal has $y dollars.
When Arjun gives $30 to Sajal, Sajal's new amount is $y + $30 = $y + 30.
Since Sajal will have twice as much money left with Arjun, Arjun's new amount is $x - $30 = $x - 30.
Now, when Sajal gives $10 to Arjun, Arjun's new amount is $x - $30 + $10 = $x - $30 + 10.
Since Arjun will have thrice as much money left with Sajal as Sajal has with Arjun, Sajal's new amount is $y + $10 = $y + 10.
Now, we can set up a proportion to find the value of x and y:
x - $30 = $x - 30
y + $10 = $y + 10
Solving these proportions, we get:
x = 62
y = 42

So, Arjun has $62 dollars and Sajal has $42 dollars. The answer is (D) 42.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 56
B) 58
C) 60
D) 62
E) 64[/INST]A: To find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, we need to find the perimeter of each triangle and then add them up.
The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the base of each triangle is 70 / 2 = 35 feet. The height of each triangle is 4 feet, since the cloth was trimmed by 4 feet on one edge.
The perimeter of each triangle is 35 + 35 + 35 = 105 feet. Since there are two triangles, the total perimeter of the original piece of cloth is 2 x 105 = 210 feet.

Answer Choices:
A) 20
B) 30
C) 40
D) 200
E) None[/INST]A: We are given that M = abc is a three-digit number and N = cba. We are also given that M > N, and M - N + 396c = 990.
To find the number of values of M that are more than 300, we can use the information that M > N. Since N = cba, we can write M > N as a = bc.
Now, we are given that M - N + 396c = 990. Rearranging this equation, we get:
M - bc + 396c = 990
Since M is a three-digit number, we know that M - bc is a two-digit number. Therefore, the left-hand side of the above equation is always greater than 396c.
So, there are only two possibilities:
M - bc = 396c or M - bc = 296c
Since M - bc = 396c is not possible since M is greater than N, we must have M - bc = 296c. Therefore, there are 20 values of M that are more than 300. The answer is B: 30.",A

What could be the least possible no of students in the school ?
Answer Choices:
A) 550
B) 570
C) 600
D) 700
E) none of these[/INST]A: Let's use the information given in the problem to find the least possible number of students in the school:
20% of the students took physics, so the number of students who took physics is 0.2 \* 501 = 100.
28% of the students took math, so the number of students who took math is 0.28 \* 501 = 140.
Since the total number of students in the school is 501, we can set up the following equation:
100 + 140 = 501
Solving for the least possible number of students, we get:
501 = 100 + 140 + x
Where x is the least possible number of students.
Subtracting 100 from both sides gives us:
401 = 140 + x
Dividing both sides by 140 gives us:
2.86 = x
Since x is a whole number, we can round up to the nearest whole number, which is 301.
Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 301. The answer is E.",E

D) 1

E) 1
800[/INST]A: To find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine so that he makes a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount, we need to calculate the selling price and the profit percentage.
Let the cost price of the sewing machine be Rs. 1200.
If Karan offers a 20% discount, the discount amount will be 20% of the cost price, which is Rs. 240 (20% of Rs. 1200).
So, the selling price of the sewing machine will be:
Selling price = Cost price - Discount amount
= Rs. 1200 - Rs. 240
= Rs. 960
To find the profit percentage, we need to calculate the profit as a percentage of the selling price:
Profit percentage = (Profit/Selling price) x 100
= (Rs. 240/Rs. 960) x 100
= 25%
So, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine is:
Rs. 1000 (1200 - 240)

Answer Choices:
A) 750 pi
B) 1500 pi
C) 1875 pi
D) 3000 pi
E) 7500 pi[/INST]A: To find the distance traveled by the point on the edge of the fan blade, we need to use the formula:
Distance = R x T x π
Where R is the radius of the fan blade, T is the time in seconds, and π is the mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14.
We are given that the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute, so the radius of the fan blade is:
R = 10 cm / 300 rpm = 0.0333 m
Now, we need to find the distance traveled in 30 seconds:

Now, let's substitute the values in the given expression:
x = ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( n + 4 √ n + 4 )

Substituting n = 24, we get:
x = ( 24 2 + 2 √ 24 ( 24 + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 24 + 4 √ 24 + 4 )

B) 4 months
C) 23 months
D) 24 months
E) 84 months[/INST]A: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:
* John started the business with Rs. 40,000.
* B joined the business 2 months after John started it.
* C joined the business after some more time (not specified).
* At the end of the year, the total profit was Rs. 375,000.
* C got Rs. 150,000 as his share of the profit.
Now, let's calculate the time it took for C to join the business:
C joined the business after some more time after B joined.
So, the time it took for B to join the business = 2 months.
Therefore, the time it took for C to join the business = 2 + x months, where x is the time it took for B to join the business.
We are given that C joined the business after 23 months, so the time it took for B to join the business = 23 - 2 = 21 months.

If these semi circles are cut down what is the area of the remaining paper ?
Answer Choices:
A) 8.75
B) 8.79
C) 8.75
D) 8.71
E) 8.72[/INST]A: To find the area of the remaining paper, we need to find the area of the square part of the paper minus the area of the two semi-circles.
The area of the square part of the paper is 20 cm x 20 cm = 400 cm^2.
The area of each semi-circle is π x radius^2, where radius is half the diameter. Since the diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, the radius is 10 cm. The area of each semi-circle is therefore π x (10 cm)^2 = 314.15 cm^2.
So the total area of the two semi-circles is 2 x 314.15 = 628.3 cm^2.
The area of the remaining paper is 400 cm^2 - 628.3 cm^2 = -228.3 cm^2.

Answer Choices:
A) M + N / 8
B) 2 M + N / 8
C) M + N / 4
D) M + 3 N / 8
E) M + N / 5[/INST]A: To find the average speed for these two activities combined, we need to find the total distance traveled and divide it by the total time taken.
The athlete runs M miles in 4 hours, so the total distance traveled is M x 4 = 4M.
The athlete then rides a bike N miles in the same number of hours, so the total distance traveled is N x 4 = 4N.
The total distance traveled is the sum of the distance traveled by both activities, so the average speed is:

E) None of the above[/INST]A: To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the passage. Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, and then turned around and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
Let's first find out how long it took Kevin to reach B. Since he was 70 miles away from A when he started, and he traveled at a constant speed of 70 mph, it took him 1 hour to reach B.
Now, 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, which means he had already traveled for 2 hours. So, the distance between A and B is:
Distance = Speed x Time = 70 mph x 2 hours = 140 miles
Therefore, the distance between A and B is 140 miles. The answer is B.",A

If 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are melted and mixed to form alloy Z , what is the ratio of zinc and copper in the alloy Z ?
Answer Choices:
A) 69 : 91
B) 59 : 91
C) 59 : 90
D) 59 : 91
E) 69 : 101[/INST]A: Let's use the information given in the problem to find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z.
We know that alloy X has a ratio of 6:9, which means that for every 6 grams of zinc, there are 9 grams of copper. Similarly, alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11, which means that for every 7 grams of zinc, there are 11 grams of copper.
When 40 grams of alloy X and 60 grams of alloy Y are mixed, the total amount of zinc is 40 + 60 = 100 grams, and the total amount of copper is 60 + 60 = 120 grams.
So, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is:
Alloy X: 6:9 = 60:90
Alloy Y: 7:11 = 70:110
When we mix these two ratios, we get:
60:90 + 70:110 = 130:120

C) 9 ½ km / h
D) 8 km / h
E) 81 km / h[/INST]A: To find the average speed, we need to add the two speeds and divide by the total time.
The man walked at 5 kmph for 6 hours, so the distance covered is:
5 kmph x 6 h = 30 km
He then walked at 4 kmph for 12 hours, so the distance covered is:
4 kmph x 12 h = 48 km
The total distance covered is:
30 km + 48 km = 78 km
Now, let's find the average speed:

Ram meets Krishna at point C on the road after 10 seconds . Find the total distance between A to B .
Answer Choices:
A) 700 meters
B) 1000 meters
C) 700 kilometers
D) 555 meters
E) 600 meters[/INST]A: To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of relative speed, which is the speed at which the two objects are moving relative to each other. In this case, Ram is moving at a speed of 20 m/s, and Krishna is moving at a speed of 40 m/s.
Let the distance between A and B be x meters. Then, the distance between A and C (where Ram meets Krishna) is x + 10 meters.
We know that Ram meets Krishna after 10 seconds, so the relative distance between A and C is:
Relative distance = Distance between A and C / Time taken to travel that distance
= (x + 10) / 10
Now, we need to find the average speed of Ram and Krishna during the time they are moving relative to each other. The average speed is:
Average speed = Total distance / Time taken to travel that distance
= (x + 10) / 10
Now, we can use the concept of relative speed to find the distance between A and B:
Distance between A and B = (Ram's speed + Krishna's speed) x Time taken to travel that distance / 2
= (20 + 40) x 10 / 2
= 150 meters
So, the distance between A and B is 150 meters. The answer is B.",E

A) 42 kms / hr
B) 41 km / hr
C) 43 kms / hr
D) 45 kms / hr
E) None of these[/INST]A: To find the difference in the speed of the two cars, we need to find the difference in their distances covered and divide it by the time taken.
Car 'X' covers a distance of 320 km in 8 hours, so its speed is:
Speed of Car 'X' = Distance / Time = 320 km / 8 hrs = 40 km/hr
Car 'Y' covers a distance of 415 km in 5 hours, so its speed is:
Speed of Car 'Y' = Distance / Time = 415 km / 5 hrs = 83 km/hr
Now, the difference in their speeds is:
Difference in Speed = Speed of Car 'Y' - Speed of Car 'X' = 83 km/hr - 40 km/hr = 43 km/hr

At what time do the 2 trains cross one another ?
Answer Choices:
A) 1 hr 23 min
B) 1 hr 15 min
C) 1 hr 8 min
D) 56 min
E) 55 min[/INST]A: To find the time at which the two trains cross each other, we need to find the time difference between the departure times of the two trains from their respective cities.
Train M leaves City A at 5 am, so it takes 4 hours to reach City B.
Train N leaves City B at 7 am, so it takes 2 hours to reach City A.
Therefore, the time at which the two trains cross each other is:
Train M reaches City B at 9 am + 4 hours = 1 pm.
Train N reaches City A at 10:30 am + 2 hours = 12:30 pm.
The time at which the two trains cross each other is 12:30 pm. The answer is (D) 56 min.",D

Answer Choices:
A) 1 minute
B) 2 minutes
C) 3 minutes
D) 4 minutes
E) 5 minutes[/INST]A: To find the time it takes for Janice and Jennie to collectively bike 1 mile, we need to find the total time they have biked so far.
Janice bikes at 10 miles per hour, so she has biked 1/10 of a mile in 1 hour.
Jennie bikes at 20 miles per hour, so she has biked 1/20 of a mile in 1 hour.
Together, they have biked 1/10 + 1/20 = 3/20 of a mile in 1 hour.
To find the time it takes for them to bike 1 mile, we divide the distance by their combined speed:
1 mile / (10 + 20) = 1 mile / 30 = 1/30 of an hour.
So it takes them collectively 1/30 of an hour to bike 1 mile. The answer is B, 2 minutes.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 2.6 m
B) 3.9 m
C) 4 m
D) 4.2 m
E) 4.4 m[/INST]A: Let's analyze the problem:
The height of the room is 2 : 5 to the semi-perimeter, which means the semi-perimeter is 2 x 5 = 10 meters.
The cost of paper for the walls is Rs. 260, and the width of the paper is 50 cm. So, the area of the walls is 10 meters x 50 cm = 500 sq. meters.
Since there is an area of 15 sq. m for doors and windows, the total area of the walls is 500 sq. m - 15 sq. m = 485 sq. m.
Now, we need to find the height of the room. Since the height is 2 : 5 to the semi-perimeter, the height is 2/5 of the semi-perimeter. Therefore, the height is 2/5 x 10 = 4 meters.
So, the height of the room is 4 meters. The answer is B).",C

Answer Choices:
A) 10 ! / 3
B) 10 ! / 6
C) 10 ! / 2
D) 10 ! / 4
E) 10 ! / 5[/INST]A: In this problem, we are given that there are 10 speakers who will address the meeting, and the only protocol to be observed is that the PM should speak before the MP, and the MP should speak before the MLA.
To find the number of ways the meeting can be held, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion principle.
There are 10! = 10 x 9 x 8 x ... x 2 x 1 ways to arrange the speakers in a particular order.
However, we are told that the PM should speak before the MP, and the MP should speak before the MLA. So, we need to exclude the arrangements where the PM speaks after the MP or the MP speaks after the MLA.
There are 9! = 9 x 8 x 7 x ... x 2 x 1 ways to arrange the speakers in a particular order without the PM speaking after the MP or the MP speaking after the MLA.
So, the total number of ways the meeting can be held is:
10! - 9! = 10 x 9 x 8 x ... x 2 x 1 - 9 x 8 x 7 x ... x 2 x 1 = 100 - 84 = 16 ways.

Expenditure = 70% of new income = 0.7 x new income
New expenditure = 0.7 x 1.2 x old income = 0.7 x 1.2 x old income

At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X . Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X . Once Bob reaches X , he changes his direction and returns to Y . Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78 kmph . By the time they meet for the second time , Bob covers 48 km more than Allen . Find the distance between X and Y .
Answer Choices:
A) 144 km
B) 72 km
C) 126 km
D) 84 km
E) 48 km[/INST]A: To solve this problem, we need to use the information that Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78 kmph. We also know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time.
Let's assume that Allen covers x km in his first journey, and Bob covers y km in his first journey. Since Bob starts from Y, his distance traveled in the first journey is y.
When Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X, so his distance traveled in the second journey is -x.
Since Bob starts from Y and goes towards X, his distance traveled in the second journey is x + 48.
We know that the distance between X and Y is the total distance traveled by both Allen and Bob, so we can write:
Distance = x + x + 48
Simplifying, we get:
Distance = 2x + 48

Now, we need to find the value of x. We know that Allen reaches Y in 54 kmph, so he covers 54 km in one hour. Bob reaches X in 78 kmph, so he covers 78 km in one hour.
Since Bob covers 48 km more than Allen, Bob covers 48 km in 1 hour, and Allen covers 54 km in 1 hour.
So, the ratio of their speeds is:
78/54 = 1 + 48/x

Solving for x, we get:
x = 126 km

Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 126 km. The answer is (C).",E

A) 7.5
B) 8.9
C) 9.9
D) 11.5
E) 11.7[/INST]A: Let's call the length of the longer piece of rope x meters. Since the shorter piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the longer piece, the length of the shorter piece is x - 3 meters.
We know that the total length of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters, so we can set up the equation:
x + (x - 3) = 20
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x - 3 = 20

E) None of these[/INST]A: To find the highest simple interest rate at which the merchant can afford to borrow money, we need to find the discount rate that will allow him to take advantage of the discount offered on the invoice.
The invoice states that the terms are 4/30, which means that the merchant has 4 months to pay the invoice, and the interest rate is 100/100, or 10%.
To find the highest simple interest rate that the merchant can afford, we need to divide the discount amount by the total cost of the invoice:
Discount amount = $20,000 x 4/30 = $8,000

Answer Choices:
A) 12
B) 24
C) 42
D) 48
E) 49[/INST]A: To find the number, we can use the information given in the problem:
The two-digit number exceeds the sum of its digits by 18.
The digit at the unit place is double the digit in the tens place.
So, let the two-digit number be $ab$, where $a$ is the digit in the unit place and $b$ is the digit in the tens place.
We know that the sum of the digits of $ab$ is 18 more than $ab$. Therefore, we can write:
$a + b = 18 + ab$
Simplifying, we get:
$a + b = 2a + b$
Now, we are given that the digit in the unit place is double the digit in the tens place. So, we can write:
$a = 2b$
Substituting this in the equation above, we get:
$2b + b = 18 + ab$
Simplifying, we get:
$3b = 18 + ab$
Now, we are asked to find the number. So, we need to solve for $b$.
$b = \frac{18 + ab}{3}$
So, the number is $ab$.

Answer Choices:
A) 2400
B) 2500
C) 2600
D) 2700
E) None of these[/INST]A: To find Mohan's share, we need to calculate the amount that he will receive at the age of 26, given that the total amount is Rs. 5100 and the interest rate is 4%.
Let's first calculate the amount that Sohan will receive at the age of 26:
Sohan's share = 5100 x (1 + 0.04)^26 = Rs. 8560
Now, we need to find out how much Mohan will receive to get the same amount as Sohan. Since Mohan is 23 years old, he will receive the same amount as Sohan in 3 years, so:
Mohan's share = Sohan's share / (1 + 0.04)^3 = Rs. 8560 / (1 + 0.04)^3 = Rs. 2400
Therefore, Mohan's share is Rs. 2400. The answer is B.",B

A) y / ( 1200 xy)
B) 20 xy / w
C) 5 xy / ( 12 w)
D) w / ( 3 xy)
E) 3 y / ( wx)[/INST]A: To find the time it takes for a certain amount of liquid to pass through a drain, we can use the formula:
Time = Total volume / Rate
Where ""Time"" is the time it takes for the liquid to pass through the drain, ""Total volume"" is the total amount of liquid that needs to pass through the drain, and ""Rate"" is the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain.
In this problem, the rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is given as w/25 gallons per second, and the total volume of liquid that needs to pass through the drain is given as y gallons.
So, we can plug these values into the formula to get:
Time = Total volume / Rate
Time = y / (w/25)
Time = y / 25
Now, we are asked to choose the correct answer from the following options:
A) y / (1200 xy)
B) 20 xy / w
C) 5 xy / (12 w)
D) w / (3 xy)

Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams[/INST]A: To find the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum, we need to know the weight of the coin made of the alloy. Since the weight of the coin made of the alloy is 30 grams, and the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver, we can use the density of aluminum to find the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum.
The density of aluminum is 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter. So, the volume of the coin made of pure aluminum will be:
Volume of coin = Volume of coin made of alloy x Density of aluminum
= 2 x 15 x 2 = 90 cubic centimeters
The weight of the coin made of pure aluminum will be:
Weight of coin = Volume of coin x Density of aluminum
= 90 x 2.7 = 243 grams
So, the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum is 243 grams. The answer is B.",B

Answer Choices:
A) 10
B) 11
C) 12
D) 13
E) 14[/INST]A: Let's analyze the problem:
We are given that when we divide 2272 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder.
So, we can write:
2272 = N x 100 + r
where r is the remainder.
Similarly, when we divide 875 by N, we get:
875 = N x 100 + r
Now, we are asked to find the sum of the digits of N.
So, we can write:
N = 10x + 100
where x is the digit in the tens place.
Substituting this value of N into the first equation, we get:
10x + 100 = 227
Similarly, substituting the value of N into the second equation, we get:
10x + 100 = 875
Now, we can see that the two equations are identical, except for the value of x.
So, the sum of the digits of N is:
10 + 10 + 1 = 21

Answer Choices:
A) $ 83
B) $ 92
C) $ 90
D) $ 97
E) $ 104[/INST]A: To find the wage on the 8th day, we need to find the average wage for the entire period of 15 days.
First, find the total wages for the entire period:
Total wages = $90 per day x 15 days = $1,350
Now, find the average wage for the first 7 days:
Average wage for first 7 days = Total wages / 7 days = $1,350 / 7 = $192
Find the average wage for the last 7 days:
Average wage for last 7 days = Total wages / 7 days = $1,350 / 7 = $192
Now, find the wage on the 8th day:
Wage on 8th day = Average wage for entire period + Wage on 8th day
= $192 + $92
= $284
Therefore, the wage on the 8th day is $284. The answer is B.",D

Answer Choices:
A) 5 / 7
B) 3 / 5
C) 4 / 7

E) 2 / 7[/INST]A: To determine the probability that a number chosen from Set S is relatively prime to 1,000, we need to find the number of numbers in Set S that are relatively prime to 1,000.
A number is relatively prime to 1,000 if it does not share any common positive factors other than 1 with 1,000. Since 1,000 is a prime number, any number that does not divide 1,000 is relatively prime to 1,000.
There are 1000 numbers in Set S, and none of them divides 1,000, so the probability that a number chosen from Set S is relatively prime to 1,000 is 100%.

C) $ 54
000
D) $ 59
000
E) $ 62
000[/INST]A: To find the original amount invested, we can use the formula for compound interest:
A = P x (1 + r)^n
where A is the future value of the investment, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years the investment is made.
In this case, the future value of the investment is $54,080, and the number of years is 1. So, we can set up the equation:
A = P x (1 + r)^n
Substating the given information, we get:
A = $54,080 x (1 + 0.08)^1
Solving for P, we get:
P = $54,080 / (1 + 0.08)^1
= $45,000
So, Charles originally invested $45,000. The answer is B.",B

When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father . Find the age of Joe ' s father ?
Answer Choices:
A) 45
B) 48
C) 50
D) 55
E) 58[/INST]A: Let's analyze the information given in the problem:
1. Joe's age, Joe's sister's age, and Joe's father's age sum up to 100.
2. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
3. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
From the third statement, we can write an equation:
Joe's father's age = 2(Joe's sister's age)
Joe's father's age = 2(x)
where x is Joe's sister's age.
Now, we know that Joe's age, Joe's sister's age, and Joe's father's age sum up to 100, so we can write:
Joe's age + Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age = 100
Substituting the equation we derived from the third statement, we get:
Joe's age + 2x + Joe's father's age = 100
Now, we are given that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. So, we can set up the equation:
Joe's age = x
Substating the equation, we get:
Joe's age = 50
Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 50 + 2(50) = 100. The answer is (D) 55.",C

Answer Choices:
A) 26.2 %
B) 32.8 %
C) 43.7 %
D) 59.0 %
E) 65.6 %[/INST]A: Since there is a 90% chance that a registered voter in Burghtown voted in the last election, the probability of a randomly chosen registered voter voting in the last election is 90%.
Now, let's find the probability of exactly 4 of 5 registered voters voting in the last election.
The probability of the first voter voting in the last election is 90%, and the probability of the second voter voting in the last election is also 90%, since the first two voters are independent events.
The probability of the third voter voting in the last election is also 90%, since the first three voters are independent events.
The probability of the fourth voter voting in the last election is 90% again, since the first four voters are independent events.
The probability of the fifth voter voting in the last election is 90% once more, since the first five voters are independent events.
Therefore, the probability of exactly 4 of 5 registered voters voting in the last election is:

Since the yard has an area of 240 square meters, and one side is 10 meters unfenced, the width of the yard is 240 / 10 = 24 meters.
Now, we can use the formula again:
Length of fencing = Area of yard / Width of yard
Length of fencing = 240 / 24 = 10 meters
So, Alice needs 10 meters of fencing to surround three sides of her rectangular yard. The answer is A, 58 meters.",A
