The probability of Stock A increasing in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability of Stock B increasing in value during the next month is 0.74. The probability of neither Stock A nor Stock B increasing in value during the next month is therefore:
Complement of (Stock A increases in value) ⋀ (Stock B increases in value) = 1 - 0.56 ⋀ 0.74 = 0.26

Explanation:
The train was initially traveling at a speed of 100 miles per hour, so it covered 100/10 = 10 miles in one hour.
After covering quarter of the distance, the train's speed is reduced to 75 miles per hour, so it covers 75/10 = 7.5 miles in one hour.
The total distance traveled is 10 + 7.5 = 17.5 miles.
To find the total journey duration, we divide the total distance by the reduced speed: 17.5 / 75 = 11.5 hours.",C

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit ( revenue from sales minus production costs ) will be at least $ 626,400 ?
Answer Choices:
A) 226
B) 230
C) 240
D) 260
E) 280[/INST]A: The answer is B, 230.
To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the revenue from sales and subtract the production costs.
Revenue = Number of components x Selling price per component
= 420 x 230
= 9,040
Production Costs = 420 x 110
= 46,800
Yearly Profit = Revenue - Production Costs
= 9,040 - 46,800
= -37,760
Since we want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, we need to set the selling price per component to be greater than or equal to $230.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is B, 230.",B

10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers produced on Monday is 10% of 720 (the total number of staplers produced on Monday), which is 72.
2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of non-defective staplers rejected is 2% of 720, which is 14.4 (round down to 14).
So, the total number of staplers produced on Monday is 72 + 14 = 86.",A

E) 32.51 %[/INST]A: The answer is C, 39.86%.
Explanation:
John replaces 15% of the original 50% strong milk tea with milk, which means the concentration of tea becomes 50% - 15% = 35%.
Then, he replaces 10% of the resultant solution (35%) with more milk, which is 35% - 10% = 25%.
Therefore, the final concentration of tea that John drinks is 25%.",E

The total number of students is a 4 digit number . Find the diffrence between maximum number of students and minimum number of students .
Answer Choices:
A) 8880
B) 8870
C) 8890
D) 7890
E) 6780[/INST]A: The answer is B, 8870.
Let's analyze the information given:
* 1/16 of the students study math, which means 16 / 16 = 1 of the students study math.
* 1/10 of the students study bio, which means 10 / 10 = 10 of the students study bio.
* 1/8 of the students study English, which means 8 / 8 = 1 of the students study English.
So, the total number of students is:
1 + 10 + 1 = 12 students.
Therefore, the maximum number of students is 12, and the minimum number of students is 1. The difference between the maximum and minimum numbers is 11 (12 - 1).",A

Answer Choices:
A) 2 miles
B) 2.25 miles
C) 3.25 miles
D) 3.85 miles
E) 2.85 miles[/INST]A: The answer is B: 2.25 miles.
To find the distance traveled by Bill on a windy day in 21 minutes, we need to first find his average speed on a windy day. Since his average speed on a normal day is 15 mph, and his speed is reduced by 4 mph on a windy day, his average speed on a windy day is:
15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph
Now, we know that Bill travels for 21 minutes, so we can use the formula:
Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 11 mph x 21 minutes
Distance = 231 meters
Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:
Distance = 225 meters
So, Bill travels 225 meters on a windy day in 21 minutes.",D

C) Rs . 787.50
D) Rs . 750
E) Rs . 780[/INST]A: The answer is B, Rs. 712.50.

After a 5% discount, the price becomes x - (5/100)x = 95% of x.
After a 7% discount, the price becomes x - (7/100)x = 93% of x.
The profit of the shopkeeper is given as Rs. 15 less than the marked price. So, we can set up the following equation:

B) 2520

E) None[/INST]A: The answer is B: 2520.
Let's break down the problem:
The student found the value of 7 / 18 of a number, which means the number is 18 times greater than the value of 7 / 8 of that number.
So, if the student's answer is x, the actual value of 7 / 8 of the number is 7x.
Since the student's answer differed from the actual value by 770, we can set up the following equation:
7x - 7x = 770
Simplifying the equation, we get:
4x = 770
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
x = 190
Therefore, the number is 190 times greater than the value of 7 / 8 of that number.",A

E) 498[/INST]A: The answer is B, 550.
To determine the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted, we need to find the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube.
The cube is 5 cm in size, and each side of the smaller cubes is 1 cm. Therefore, the total number of faces of the smaller cubes that make up the hollow cube is:
5 cm x 5 cm = 25 faces
Since the outer surface of the cube is painted, the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted is:
25 - (500 / 25) = 550.

To calculate the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 on a cab that charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and $0.10 for each additional quarter-mile:
1. Calculate the cost of the first quarter-mile: $8.50 / $3.50 = 2.40 miles
2. Calculate the cost of each additional quarter-mile: $0.10 x 2 = $0.20
3. Total cost of traveling 1 quarter-mile: $3.50 + $0.20 = $3.70
4. Total cost of traveling 1 mile: $3.70 x 100 / $8.50 = 4.37 miles
5. Maximum distance you can travel with $8.50: $4.37 miles

Answer Choices:
A) 12 / 25
B) 3 / 2
C) 3
D) 2
E) 25 / 3[/INST]A: The answer is C: 3.
Explanation:
Let's use the information given in the problem to find the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes.
We know that 6 pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as 2 rolls, so 2 rolls = 6 pita breads.
We also know that 3 rolls contain the same amount of falafel as 5 baguettes, so 5 baguettes = 3 rolls.
Now, we can use the ratio of pita breads to baguettes to find the number of pita breads that contain the same amount of falafel as 2 baguettes:
6 pita breads = 2 rolls
3 rolls = 5 baguettes
So, 2 baguettes = 3 pita breads.
Therefore, the answer is C: 3.",C

B) 20 %
C) 25 %
D) 33 %
E) 18 %[/INST]A: The answer is B, 20%. To find the percentage increase needed to return to the original price, you can use the following formula:
New price = Original price x (1 + Percentage increase)
So, if the shopkeeper originally had an item priced at $100, and he wants to return to the original price after the discount day, he would need to increase the price by 20%:
New price = $100 x (1 + 0.20) = $120

Answer Choices:
A) 238
B) 289
C) 200
D) 287
E) 187[/INST]A: The answer is B: 289 miles.
Explanation:
Let's assume that the ship traveled at a speed of x miles per hour, and the plane started with a speed of 10x miles per hour.
The distance traveled by the ship is given as 180 miles, so the time it took the ship to travel that distance is:
Time = Distance / Speed = 180 / x
Now, the plane started with a speed of 10x miles per hour, so it will take it half the time it took the ship to travel the same distance:
Time = Distance / Speed = 180 / (10x) = 180 / 10 = 18 hours
Since the plane started 180 miles ahead of the ship, they will meet after 18 hours. Therefore, the answer is B: 289 miles.",C

Answer Choices:
A) 300
B) 500
C) 5000
D) 6000
E) 7500[/INST]A: The answer is B, 500.
The information given in the problem is:
* 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned in 2001.
* During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year.
To find the total deer population in the forest, we need to use the information that only 20 of the 500 deer caught in 2002 had tags from the previous year. This means that the percentage of deer in the forest with tags is the same as the percentage of deer caught in 2002 that had tags.
So, the total deer population in the forest is:
Total deer population = Number of deer caught in 2002 with tags / Number of deer caught in 2002
= 20 / 500
= 1/25
Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 500.",E

Answer Choices:
A) 56
B) 58
C) 60
D) 62
E) 64[/INST]A: The answer is B, 58.
To find the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth, we need to find the perimeter of each half triangle and then add them up.
The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the length of each triangle is half the length of the original square cloth. Since the cloth was trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the length of the original cloth was 4 feet more than the length of each triangle.
Therefore, the perimeter of each triangle is:
Perimeter of each triangle = 2(length + width)
= 2(4 + 4)
= 8 + 8
= 16 feet

So, the perimeter of the original square cloth is:
Perimeter of original cloth = 2 x perimeter of each triangle
= 2 x 16
= 32 feet

Therefore, the answer is B, 58.",A

Cost price = Original price - Profit = 27.50 - 2.75 = 24.75
If the book were sold for Rs 25.75, then the profit percentage would be:
Profit percentage = (Selling price - Cost price) / Cost price = (25.75 - 24.75) / 24.75 = 3%

E) 1
800[/INST]A: The answer is B: 1875.
To find the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine so that he makes a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount, we need to calculate the selling price and the profit percentage.
First, let's calculate the discount percentage:
20% of Rs. 1200 = Rs. 240
So, the discount amount is Rs. 240.
Now, let's calculate the selling price:
Selling price = Original price - Discount amount
Selling price = Rs. 1200 - Rs. 240 = Rs. 960
To find the profit percentage, we need to calculate the profit = Selling price - Cost price / Selling price x 100
Profit = Rs. 960 - Rs. 1200 / Rs. 960 x 100 = 20%
So, the price at which Karan should mark the sewing machine is Rs. 1875 (1200 + 20% of 1200 = 1875).",E

Train ‘ B ’ leaves Mumbai Central for Lucknow by the same route at 2 pm on the same day , running at the speed of 72 kmph . At what time will the two trains meet each other ?
Answer Choices:
A) 12 am on the next day
B) 5 am on the next day
C) 5 pm on the next day
D) 2 pm on the next day
E) None of these[/INST]A: The answer is B - 5 am on the next day.
To find the time when the two trains will meet, we need to calculate the time taken by each train to cover the distance between Mumbai Central and Lucknow.
Train A is running at a speed of 40 kmph, so it will take:
Time = Distance / Speed = 500 km / 40 kmph = 12.5 hours
Train B is running at a speed of 72 kmph, so it will take:
Time = Distance / Speed = 500 km / 72 kmph = 7.14 hours
Since both trains are running in the same direction, they will meet each other at a point halfway between Mumbai Central and Lucknow. Therefore, the time when the two trains will meet each other is:
Time = (12.5 hours + 7.14 hours) / 2 = 9.27 hours

If there is exactly one water lily on the lake , it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies . In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies , if initially there were 64 water lilies on it ?
Answer Choices:
A) 15
B) 28
C) 30
D) 53
E) 59[/INST]A: The answer is B, 28 days.
Explanation:
If there are initially 64 water lilies on the lake, and the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then there will be 64 + 64 = 128 water lilies on the lake after two days.
After four days, there will be 128 + 128 = 256 water lilies on the lake.
Since the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 60 days, and it takes 28 days to double the number of water lilies, it will take 60 / 28 = 2.14 days to fully cover the lake with water lilies. Therefore, the answer is 28 days.",D

Since B bisects minor arc AC, the measure of minor arc AD is equal to the difference between the measures of minor arcs AC and BD.
Minor arc AC measures 160 °, and minor arc BD measures 150 °, so the measure of minor arc AD is:

The radius of the fan blade is 10 cm, and the fan runs at 300 revolutions per minute.
So, the distance traveled by the point in 30 seconds is:
distance = 10 cm x 300 revolutions/minute x 30 seconds = 1500 pi cm

x = ( n 2 + 2 √ n ( n + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( n + 4 √ n + 4 )
Substituting n = 36, we get:
x = ( 36 2 + 2 √ 36 ( 36 + 4 ) + 16 ) / ( 36 + 4 √ 36 + 4 )

Answer Choices:
A) 50 m
B) 75 m
C) 100 m
D) 125 m
E) 150 m[/INST]A: The answer is B, 75 m.
To solve this problem, we need to use the information given in the question:
* The space shuttle can travel 700 m high in 40 seconds.
* It will take 5 seconds to pass a point.
We can use the formula: distance = speed x time to find the length of the space shuttle:
Distance = Speed x Time
700 m = Speed x 40 s
Speed = 700 m / 40 s = 17.5 m/s
Now, we need to find the length of the space shuttle:
Length = Speed x Time
Length = 17.5 m/s x 5 s = 87.5 m
Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is 87.5 m.",C

At the end of the year , out of a total profit of Rs . 375,000 , C gets Rs . 150,000 as his share . How many months after B joined the business , did C join ?
Answer Choices:
A) 2 months
B) 4 months
C) 23 months
D) 24 months
E) 84 months[/INST]A: The answer is B: 4 months.
Let's analyze the given information:
* John started the business with Rs. 40,000.
* B joined 2 months after John started the business.
* C joined after some more time.
* At the end of the year, the total profit was Rs. 375,000.
* C got Rs. 150,000 as his share.
We can set up the following equation:
40,000 + 60,000 + 120,000 = 375,000
Solving for the number of months, we get:
40,000 + 60,000 + 120,000 = 375,000
300,000 = 375,000 / 4
4 = 90,000
So, C joined the business 90,000 months after John started it. Since the business started 2 months ago, C joined 88 months after John started the business (2 + 88 = 90). Therefore, the answer is B: 4 months.",B

A) 42 kms / hr
B) 41 km / hr
C) 43 kms / hr
D) 45 kms / hr
E) None of these[/INST]A: The answer is B, 41 km/hr.
To find the difference in the speed of the two cars, we need to find the difference in the distances they cover:
Distance covered by Car 'X' = 320 km
Distance covered by Car 'Y' = 415 km
Difference in distance = 415 km - 320 km = 95 km
Now, we need to divide the difference in distance by the time taken by each car to cover that distance:
Speed of Car 'X' = 320 km / 8 hrs = 40 km/hr
Speed of Car 'Y' = 415 km / 5 hrs = 83 km/hr
Difference in speed = 83 km/hr - 40 km/hr = 43 km/hr
Therefore, the difference in the speed of the two cars is 43 km/hr.",C

B) 120
C) 240
D) 320
E) 360[/INST]A: The answer is B, 120 yellow golf balls.
Here's how we can calculate it:
The store started with 600 golf balls in stock, and sold 80% of its inventory. That means it sold 480 golf balls (80% of 600).
Since it sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls it had at the beginning of the day is equal to the number of golf balls it sold.
So, the number of yellow golf balls it had at the beginning of the day is 480 / 2 = 240.",E

Answer Choices:
A) 50 %
B) 60 %
C) 55 %
D) 70 %
E) 58 %[/INST]A: The answer is B, 60%.
To calculate the percentage gain, we need to first find the profit made by the merchant. The profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price from the selling price:
Profit = Selling Price - Cost Price
= 90 kg x Rs. 7.50 per kg - Rs. 450
= Rs. 6750 - Rs. 450
= Rs. 6300

Now, to find the percentage gain, we divide the profit by the cost price and multiply by 100:
Percentage Gain = (Profit / Cost Price) x 100
= (63000 / 450) x 100
= 60%
Therefore, the percentage gain of the merchant is 60%.",A

Answer Choices:
A) 144 km

E) 48 km[/INST]A: The answer is B, 72 km.
Let's analyze the given information:
Allen travels at 54 kmph, so he covers 54 km in one hour.
Bob travels at 78 kmph, so he covers 78 km in one hour.
When Allen reaches Y, he changes his direction and returns to X, so he covers a distance of 54 km + 54 km = 108 km.
Bob reaches X at the same time as Allen, so he covers a distance of 78 km + 54 km = 132 km.
By the time they meet for the second time, Bob has covered 132 km - 54 km = 78 km more than Allen.

C) L ( x
y) < R ( x
y)
D) L ( x
y) < R ( x
y)
E) None[/INST]A: The answer is B: L(x,y)≠R(x,y).
Explanation:
Let's consider the function L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y].
We know that [x] = 0, [y] = 0, and [x+y] = 1, so L(0,0) = 1.
Now, suppose x and y are positive real numbers. We have:
L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [x] + [y] + 1 = x + y + 1
On the other hand, we have:
R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2x + 2y.
Therefore, we have:
L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) because L(x,y) = x + y + 1 is not equal to R(x,y) = 2x + 2y.
So, the statement is true, and the answer is B.",D

Let's calculate the probability of each friend answering the question correctly:
* Alan: 1 / 5
* Roger: 2 / 3 (since he cheated)
* Peter: 5 / 6 (since he performed the calculations and marked the answer correctly)
Now, we want to find the probability that the question is answered correctly without cheating. Since Roger cheated, we need to subtract his probability from the total probability of correct answers:
Probability of correct answers without cheating = Total probability of correct answers - Probability of correct answers with cheating
= 1 / 9 - 2 / 9
= 1 / 9
Therefore, the probability that the question is answered correctly but not via cheating is 1 / 9, which is option B.",A

If the weight of the coin is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy equals that of silver , what will be the weight of a coin measuring 1 x 30 mm made of pure aluminum if silver is twice as heavy as aluminum ?
Answer Choices:
A) 36 grams
B) 40 grams
C) 42 grams
D) 48 grams
E) 50 grams[/INST]A: The answer is B, 40 grams.
To find the weight of a coin made of pure aluminum, we need to know the weight of the coin made of the alloy and the proportion of aluminum to silver in the alloy. Since the weight of the coin made of the alloy is 30 grams and the volume of aluminum in the alloy is equal to the volume of silver, we can use the density of aluminum to find the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum.
The density of aluminum is 2.7 grams per cubic centimeter, so the weight of the coin made of pure aluminum will be:
Weight of coin = Volume of coin x Density of aluminum
Weight of coin = 1 x 30 mm x 2.7 grams/cm^3 = 74 grams

When Joe is as old as his father , Joe ' s sister will be twice as old as now . When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father . Find the age of Joe ' s father ?
Answer Choices:
A) 45
B) 48
C) 50
D) 55
E) 58[/INST]A: The answer is B, 48.
Let's analyze the given information:
1. ""Joe's age, Joe's sister's age, and Joe's father's age sum up to 100.""
So, Joe's age = 100 - (Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age)
2. ""When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.""
So, Joe's sister's age = 2(Joe's age)
3. ""When Joe is as old as his father, then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.""
So, Joe's father's age = 2(Joe's sister's age)
Now, we have two equations:
1. Joe's age = 100 - (Joe's sister's age + Joe's father's age)
2. Joe's sister's age = 2(Joe's age)
Solving the above equations, we get:
Joe's age = 48
Joe's sister's age = 96
Joe's father's age = 96 + 48 = 144
Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 144. The answer is (B) 48.",C
